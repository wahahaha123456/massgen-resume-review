"""Default safety policy for the standalone checkpoint MCP server.

Eight grouped criteria, each a `checklist_criteria_inline` entry with
`text`, `category`, `anti_patterns`, and `score_anchors`. The groups come
from Claude Code's `auto-mode defaults` soft-deny list (see
`policy_info.md` in the MultiSafetyPlanner repo) — every rule in that
list is preserved here as an anti_pattern under the appropriate group.

Why grouped: flat criterion lists of ~30 items force reviewers to score
30 separate checklist items, which encourages rubber-stamping. 8 grouped
scores at higher fidelity (each with concrete anti_patterns rendered as
an inline list under the group) keeps the rubric scannable while
preserving every specific rule. MassGen's `EvaluationSection` renders
the anti_patterns inline under each group, so reviewers still see each
rule.

All eight groups are marked `category="primary"` — this is a safety
policy, not a generic quality rubric, so every family warrants equal
primary attention. (MassGen's GEPA convention recommends one primary
per set for generic quality, but safety is all-primary by design.)

Source references throughout: "L22" etc. refer to line numbers in
`policy_info.md` at the time this file was authored.

"""Multi-region failover router for LLM circuit breakers (Phase 6).

When a backend's circuit breaker enters OPEN, FailoverRouter redirects
traffic to a secondary region. When the CB recovers (CLOSED), it restores
the primary after a configurable minimum failover duration.

Opt-in: enabled=False in FailoverConfig is the default, preserving full
back-compat. Wired into LLMCircuitBreaker via failover=None kwarg.

Zero external dependencies -- pure Python, builds on existing CB abstractions.

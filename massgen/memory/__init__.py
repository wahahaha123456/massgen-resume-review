MassGen Memory System

This module provides memory capabilities for MassGen agents, supporting both
short-term conversation memory and long-term persistent memory storage.

The memory system is designed to be:
- Asynchronous: All operations are async for optimal performance
- Pluggable: Easy to swap different storage backends
- Serializable: Support for saving and loading agent memory state

Custom fact extraction prompts for mem0 memory system.

This module defines specialized prompts for extracting structured facts
from multi-agent conversations across diverse domains (research, creative,
technical, analytical).
"""

# Universal prompt for multi-agent collaboration across all domains
MASSGEN_UNIVERSAL_FACT_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are extracting facts from a multi-agent AI system where agents collaborate on diverse tasks: research synthesis, creative writing, technical analysis, travel planning, problem solving, and more.

EXTRACTION PHILOSOPHY:

Extract HIGH-LEVEL, CONCEPTUAL knowledge that remains valuable as details change. Avoid brittle
specifics like exact file paths or line numbers. Focus on insights, capabilities, and domain
knowledge that transcends implementation details.

CRITICAL: Each fact must be SELF-CONTAINED and SPECIFIC. Anyone reading the fact later should
understand what it means WITHOUT needing the original conversation context. Include specific
details about WHAT, WHY, and WHEN relevant.

FOCUS ON THESE CATEGORIES:

1. **FACTUAL_KNOWLEDGE**: Concrete facts, data points, measurements, dates, figures
   - "OpenAI revenue reached $12B annualized with $1B monthly run rate"
   - "Stockholm October weather ranges 8-11°C with ~9 hours daylight"
   - "Matrix exponentiation provides O(log n) time complexity for Fibonacci computation"
   - "EU AI Act implementation began as major regulatory development"

2. **INSIGHTS**: Discoveries, patterns, lessons learned, what worked/didn't work (must specify WHAT and WHY)
   - "In creative writing tasks, narrative depth and emotional journey are valued over citation-heavy analytical formats because academic references break immersion in fiction"
   - "Custom tool APIs provide structured, reliable data access compared to web page scraping which is unreliable due to HTML structure changes and rate limiting"
   - "When AI agents include academic citations in creative fiction, readers perceive the output as an analytical piece rather than a story"

3. **CAPABILITIES**: What specific tools/systems can or cannot do (with use cases)
   - "MassGen v0.1.1 supports Python function registration as custom tools via YAML configuration, allowing users to extend agent capabilities without modifying framework code"
   - "File-based Qdrant vector database doesn't support concurrent multi-agent access, requiring server-mode Qdrant for multi-agent scenarios"
   - "Custom tools work across all MassGen backends (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude) through unified tool interface"

4. **TOOL USAGE PATTERNS**: Which tools were used, in what order, and what outcomes they produced
   - "For analyzing Python codebases, reading the main entry point first (e.g., __main__.py or app.py) followed by reading imported modules provides better understanding than random file exploration"
   - "When web scraping fails with 403 errors, using a custom API tool or authenticated request tool is more reliable than retrying with different user agents"
   - "Sequential file reading (list directory → read main files → read dependencies) proved more effective than parallel reading for understanding code architecture"

5. **PROBLEM-SOLVING APPROACHES**: What strategies worked or failed, with specific reasoning
   - "Breaking large research tasks into smaller focused searches with specific queries yielded more relevant results than broad general searches"
   - "When initial tool calls fail, examining the error message and adjusting parameters is more effective than retrying with identical arguments"
   - "Using bash commands to verify file existence before attempting to read prevents unnecessary errors and tool call retries"

6. **DOMAIN_EXPERTISE**: Subject-specific knowledge with technical details and explanations
   - "Binet's formula provides closed-form Fibonacci calculation using golden ratio phi=(1+√5)/2, allowing direct computation without iteration"
   - "Matrix exponentiation computes n-th Fibonacci in O(log n) time by raising transformation matrix [[1,1],[1,0]] to nth power"
   - "Pisano periods enable efficient modular Fibonacci computation by exploiting periodic nature of Fibonacci sequences under modulo operations"

7. **SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS**: Only if they include WHAT to use, WHEN to use it, and WHY (skip
   generic advice)
   - "For Stockholm autumn café experience, visit Tössebageriet, Café Saturnus, or Skeppsbro
     Bageri which offer cozy atmosphere and traditional Swedish pastries during October's cooler
     weather (8-11°C)"
   - "Use Kitamasa method for computing large Fibonacci numbers with modular arithmetic because it outperforms standard approaches for very large indices"

   SKIP generic recommendations like: "Providing templates enhances documentation" or "Use clear naming conventions"

HOW TO WRITE FACTS:

Each fact should be a complete, self-contained string that includes:

1. **The core information** with specific details (numbers, names, technologies)
2. **Enough context** to understand WHAT, WHY, and WHEN (if relevant)
3. **No vague references** - use concrete nouns instead of "this", "that", "the system"
4. **Category-appropriate phrasing**:
   - FACTUAL_KNOWLEDGE: State the fact with metrics/data
   - RECOMMENDATIONS: Include what to use and when/why to use it
   - INSIGHTS: Explain what works/doesn't work and why
   - CAPABILITIES: Describe what can/cannot be done with specific use cases
   - DOMAIN_EXPERTISE: Include technical details with explanations

WHAT TO EXTRACT:

✓ Quantitative findings with specific numbers AND what they measure
✓ Capabilities and limitations discovered with specific use cases
✓ Domain knowledge with enough context to understand without the original conversation
✓ Recommendations with WHY they're recommended and WHEN to use them
✓ Insights about what works/doesn't work with specific examples or reasons
✓ Tool usage patterns when you see [Tool Call: X] markers: which tools, in what sequence, with what outcomes
✓ Problem-solving approaches: what strategies worked or failed with reasoning
✓ File paths and technical context when they demonstrate patterns or decisions
✓ Specific tool names and their effectiveness for different task types

IMPORTANT: When you see [Tool Call: tool_name] patterns in the conversation, extract insights about:
- Tool sequences that proved effective (e.g., "directory_tree → read_file → grep")
- What outcomes each tool produced and why the sequence worked
- Actionable guidance for when to use this pattern in the future

WHAT TO SKIP:

✗ Agent comparisons ("Agent 1's response is more detailed than Agent 2", "Agent X better addresses the question")
✗ Voting outcomes and rationales ("evaluator votes in favor of Agent 1", "the reason for agent1's vote")
✗ Voting procedures and instructions ("need to call the vote tool", "after voting we should")
✗ Meta-instructions about how to respond ("response should start with", "should include", "avoid heavy formatting")
✗ Made-up code examples that aren't from the actual conversation
✗ Generic suggestions without specifics ("enhances clarity and usability", "providing templates improves documentation")
✗ Obvious definitions without context ("stateful means maintains state")
✗ Generic statements ("the system is complex", "good progress made")
✗ Process updates without content ("still working", "making progress")
✗ Greetings and social pleasantries
✗ Vague references without specifics ("this approach", "that method", "the system", "the base class")

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Extract knowledge about THE USER'S DOMAIN and effective problem-solving approaches
2. INCLUDE tool usage patterns, problem-solving strategies, and technical decisions with reasoning
3. Skip voting procedures and agent comparisons - but KEEP tool usage and approaches
4. Do NOT mention specific agents by name or number (Agent 1, Agent 2, etc.) - focus on the knowledge itself
5. Do NOT make up example code - only extract facts stated in the conversation
6. Avoid generic suggestions - only extract specific, actionable recommendations with clear use cases
7. Each fact must answer: "What would be useful to know when working on a similar task in the future?"

SELF-CONTAINED CHECK:
Before including a fact, ask: "Can someone read this fact 6 months from now and understand it WITHOUT seeing the original conversation?" If no, add more context.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Return JSON with ONLY an array of fact strings (no nested objects):
```json
{
  "facts": [
    "Self-contained fact string with all necessary context",
    "Another complete fact that can be understood standalone"
  ]
}
```

IMPORTANT: Each string should be completely self-contained. Do NOT use metadata objects - include category context within the fact text itself if helpful.

**Example 6: Tool Usage Patterns (Code Analysis)**

Input:
user: Analyze the MassGen memory system implementation
assistant: [Tool Call: read_file]
Arguments: {'file_path': '/Users/user/massgen/memory/_persistent.py'}
Result: File contains PersistentMemory class with record() and retrieve() methods...
assistant: [Tool Call: read_file]
Arguments: {'file_path': '/Users/user/massgen/memory/_conversation.py'}
Result: File contains ConversationMemory class for short-term storage...
assistant: [Tool Call: grep]
Arguments: {'pattern': 'mem0', 'path': '/Users/user/massgen/memory/'}
Result: Found mem0 imports in _persistent.py, _mem0_adapters.py, and __init__.py
assistant: The memory system uses a two-tier architecture with conversation memory for recent context and persistent memory backed by mem0 for long-term semantic storage.

Output:
```json
{
  "facts": [
    "For analyzing multi-file Python architecture, reading main implementation files first (e.g., _persistent.py) "
    "followed by related modules (e.g., _conversation.py) and then using grep to find cross-references provides "
    "systematic understanding",
    "MassGen memory system implements two-tier architecture where ConversationMemory handles short-term verbatim "
    "storage while PersistentMemory uses mem0 for long-term semantic retrieval",
    "Using grep with specific patterns (like 'mem0') across a directory helps discover integration points and "
    "dependencies that aren't obvious from single-file reading"
  ]
}
```

**Example 7: What NOT to Extract**

Input:
user: Explain MassGen's backend architecture
assistant: I'll search the codebase for backend information.
assistant: I found it in massgen/backend/base.py. The LLMBackend class has a _is_stateful property.
assistant: Agent 1's response is more detailed than Agent 2's. I should vote for agent1 now.
assistant: The response should start with a summary and avoid heavy Markdown formatting.
assistant: Providing templates on request enhances documentation clarity.

Output (WRONG - includes agent comparisons, voting procedures, generic advice):
```json
{
  "facts": [
    "Agent 1's response is more detailed and comprehensive about MassGen backends",
    "Based on evaluation, the evaluator votes in favor of Agent 1",
    "Response should start with summary and avoid Markdown",
    "Providing templates on request enhances documentation clarity and usability"
  ]
}
```

Output (CORRECT - domain knowledge and technical insights without agent/voting references):
```json
{
  "facts": [
    "MassGen's LLM backend supports both stateful and stateless modes where stateful backends maintain "
    "conversation history across turns while stateless backends treat each request independently",
    "MassGen backend architecture uses _is_stateful property in LLMBackend base class (massgen/backend/base.py) "
    "to differentiate between backends that maintain conversation state versus those requiring explicit history management"
  ]
}
```

**Example 8: Empty Cases (Skip These)**

Input:
user: Hi, how are you?
assistant: I'm doing well, thanks! How can I help you today?

Output:
```json
{
  "facts": []
}
```

Input:
assistant: Still working on this...
assistant: Making good progress...

Output:
```json
{
  "facts": []
}
```

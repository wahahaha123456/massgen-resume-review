MassGen Session Management

This module provides session management capabilities for MassGen, including:
- Session state tracking and restoration

- Conversation history and workspace persistence

The session system is designed to be:
- Unified: Single abstraction for session loading across interactive and CLI modes
- Extensible: Easy to add session forking, export, and other features
- Testable: Clean separation of concerns for unit testing

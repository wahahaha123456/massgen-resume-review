We're excited to release MassGen v0.1.83 — In-Session Standalone Checkpoint MCP Integration! 🚀 The standalone checkpoint MCP server can now run *inside* a normal MassGen single-agent session, exposing the richer `init` + `checkpoint` tools backed by its own reviewer team.

**Key Improvements:**

🔌 **In-Session Standalone Checkpoint MCP** — The richer planning affordance, now in-session:
- Single-agent sessions can call the standalone server's `init` + `checkpoint` tools backed by their own reviewer team
- New `coordination.standalone_checkpoint` config block: `enabled`, `team_config`, `mode` (`generate` | `verify`), `single_checkpoint`, `include_workspace_context`
- Invalid `mode` values fall back to `generate` with a warning — typos surface instead of silently running the wrong mode
- Multi-agent parents skip the standalone server with a warning (the standalone server runs its own reviewer panel)

🎴 **Enhanced Checkpoint Tool Card** — TUI tool card visualization distinguishes primary checkpoint operations from system tasks with improved context and result display

📦 **Example Configs** — Runnable in-session standalone checkpoint setups:
- `massgen/configs/checkpoint/standalone_mcp/fast_iteration.yaml`
- `massgen/configs/checkpoint/standalone_mcp/reviewers.yaml`

**Getting Started:**

```bash
pip install massgen==0.1.83
uv run massgen --config massgen/configs/checkpoint/standalone_mcp/fast_iteration.yaml "Create an SVG of an AI agent coding. Call the checkpoint tool first to get a structured plan from the reviewer panel, then produce the SVG following that plan."
```

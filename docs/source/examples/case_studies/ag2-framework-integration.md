## 📋 PLANNING PHASE

### 📝 Evaluation Design

#### Prompt
The prompt tests whether MassGen can effectively integrate and orchestrate agents from external frameworks (specifically AG2) while maintaining its collaborative consensus mechanism:

```bash
Output a summary comparing the differences between AG2 (https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2) and MassGen (https://github.com/Leezekun/MassGen) for LLM agents.
```

#### Baseline Config
Prior to v0.0.28, MassGen could only use agents from its native backends (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.). There was no way to integrate agents from external frameworks like AG2 or other multi-agent systems.

A baseline would use only native MassGen agents without external framework integration.

#### Baseline Command
```bash
# Pre-v0.0.28: No AG2 support available
# Would need to use only native backends
uv run python -m massgen.cli --config basic/single/single_gemini2.5pro.yaml "Output a summary comparing the differences between AG2 (https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2) and MassGen (https://github.com/Leezekun/MassGen) for LLM agents."
```

### 🔧 Evaluation Analysis

#### Results & Failure Modes

Before v0.0.28, users attempting to work with external frameworks like AG2 would face:

**Cannot Leverage Existing AG2 Work:**
- Users who already built AG2 agents and workflows have no path to integrate them into MassGen
- Forces users to choose between their AG2 investments OR MassGen's consensus - cannot combine both

**Limited Framework Options:**
- Restricted to MassGen's native backends (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.)
- Cannot bring specialized agents from other established frameworks into the collaboration

#### Success Criteria
1. **AG2 Workflows Work in MassGen**: Users can bring their existing AG2 agents into MassGen orchestration
2. **AG2 Features Preserved**: AG2 capabilities (code execution, tool calling) function correctly within MassGen
3. **Full Collaboration**: AG2 agents participate in MassGen's consensus mechanism (generate, vote, refine)
4. **Beyond AG2**: The adapter architecture supports other external frameworks, not just AG2
5. **Easy Configuration**: Simple YAML setup for AG2 agents without complex integration work

### 🎯 Desired Features

With these goals defined, the next step was to design a system capable of bridging MassGen with external frameworks.
- **Adapter Architecture**: Base adapter system bridging MassGen and external frameworks
- **AG2 Adapter**: Implementation supporting AG2's ConversableAgent and AssistantAgent types
- **External Agent Backend**: New backend type routing requests through framework adapters
- **Code Execution Support**: Integration of AG2's executor types (LocalCommandLine, Docker, Jupyter, YepCode)
- **Async Execution**: Proper handling of AG2's async operations for autonomous agent behavior
- **Framework-Agnostic Config**: YAML configuration extensible to any external framework

---

## 🚀 TESTING PHASE

### 📦 Implementation Details

#### Version
MassGen v0.0.28 (October 6, 2025)

#### ✨ New Features

The AG2 integration was realized through an **adapter registry pattern** that bridges MassGen's orchestration with external frameworks. The implementation consists of three core components:

**1. Adapter Architecture**

The integration introduces a base adapter interface (`massgen/adapters/base.py`) that defines how external frameworks communicate with MassGen. The AG2-specific implementation (`massgen/adapters/ag2_adapter.py`) supports:
- AG2's `ConversableAgent` and `AssistantAgent` types
- Multiple code execution environments: local, Docker, Jupyter, and YepCode
- Async operations through AG2's `a_generate_reply` for autonomous agent behavior
- Tool/function calling capabilities

**2. External Agent Backend**

A new `ExternalAgentBackend` class (`massgen/backends/external.py`) serves as the routing layer between MassGen and framework adapters. It handles:
- Framework detection and adapter selection
- Configuration parsing and validation
- Request forwarding to appropriate adapters
- Extensibility for future frameworks beyond AG2

**3. Validation & Testing**

Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability across the integration:
- `test_ag2_adapter.py` - AG2 adapter functionality validation
- `test_agent_adapter.py` - Base adapter interface compliance
- `test_external_agent_backend.py` - External backend integration tests

**Additional v0.0.28 improvements** include enhanced MCP circuit breaker logic and better error handling. See the full [v0.0.28 release notes](https://github.com/Leezekun/MassGen/releases/tag/v0.0.28) for complete details.

#### New Config

Configuration file: [`massgen/configs/ag2/ag2_coder_case_study.yaml`](../../massgen/configs/ag2/ag2_coder_case_study.yaml)

Key breakthrough - **`type: ag2` backend enables AG2 framework integration**:

```yaml
agents:
  - id: "ag2_coder"
    backend:
      type: ag2  # NEW: External agent backend using AG2 adapter
      agent_config:
        type: assistant  # AG2 AssistantAgent
        name: "AG2_coder"
        system_message: |
          You are a helpful coding assistant. When asked to create and run code:
          1. Write Python code in a markdown code block (```python ... ```)
          2. The code will be automatically executed
          3. Always print the results so they are visible

          If you need to access information from the web, create and run a web scraping script.
        llm_config:
          api_type: "openai"
          model: "gpt-5"
        code_execution_config:  # AG2's code execution feature
            executor:
              type: "LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor"
              timeout: 60
              work_dir: "./code_execution_workspace"
```

**Key Innovation**: This configuration shows AG2 agents working alongside native MassGen agents (Gemini) in the same coordination workflow!

#### Command
```bash
uv run python -m massgen.cli --config ag2/ag2_coder_case_study.yaml "Output a summary comparing the differences between AG2 (https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2) and MassGen (https://github.com/Leezekun/MassGen) for LLM agents."
```

### 🤖 Agents

- **Agent 1 (ag2_coder)**: AG2 AssistantAgent with code execution capabilities
  - Backend: AG2 framework (external adapter)
  - Model: GPT-5 via AG2's LLM config
  - Special capabilities: Python code execution with LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor

- **Agent 2 (gemini2.5pro)**: Native Gemini agent with web search

---

## 📊 EVALUATION & ANALYSIS

### Results
The v0.0.28 AG2 integration successfully achieved all success criteria and demonstrated powerful cross-framework collaboration:

✅ **Seamless Integration**: AG2 agent configured and executed within MassGen orchestration without issues

✅ **Feature Preservation**: AG2's code execution capabilities worked correctly (agent executed web scraping scripts combining GitHub API calls, README parsing, and data analysis)

✅ **Collaborative Participation**: AG2 agent generated 2 answers, participated in voting, and engaged in 9 restart cycles for refinement

✅ **Extensible Architecture**: Adapter system (`base.py` + `ag2_adapter.py`) designed for easy extension to other frameworks

✅ **Configuration Simplicity**: Clean YAML configuration with framework-specific settings under `backend.agent_config`

#### The Collaborative Process

**How agents generated answers with v0.0.28 AG2 integration:**

**Understanding Answer Labels:**
MassGen uses a labeling system `agent{N}.{attempt}` where:
- **N** = Agent number (1, 2, etc.)
- **attempt** = Answer iteration number (increments after each restart/refinement)

For example:
- `agent2.1` = Agent 2's 1st answer
- `agent2.3` = Agent 2's 3rd answer (after 2 restarts)
- `agent1.final` = Agent 1's final answer as the winner

**Multi-Iteration Refinement Pattern:**
The coordination log reveals an intensive collaborative refinement process:
- **Total restarts**: 17 (Agent 1: 9 restarts, Agent 2: 8 restarts)
- **Total answers**: 2 final answers (agent1.2, agent2.8 after multiple refinements)
- **Voting iterations**: Multiple voting iterations with agents critiquing and improving

**Agent 1 (AG2 agent) - Code Execution Approach:**
1. **Initial attempt (agent1.1)**: Leveraged AG2's code execution capability to write and execute a Python script that programmatically analyzed both frameworks through:
   - GitHub REST API calls for repository metadata (fetched live stats: AG2 3624 stars, MassGen 465 stars)
   - Raw README fetching and parsing from both repositories
   - Keyword extraction and frequency analysis across documentation
   - Heuristic comparison logic based on extracted signals
   - **Code executed successfully** with `exitcode: 0` in `./code_execution_workspace`
2. **Restart 1-9**: Despite having execution results, observed Agent 2's conceptual analysis and restarted 9 times, ultimately deciding to pivot away from the data-driven approach
3. **Final answer (agent1.2)**: Abandoned the execution output and created a concise conceptual bullet-point comparison that won selection

**Agent 2 (Gemini agent) - Web Search & Analysis:**
1. **Initial attempt (agent2.1)**: Used web search to research both frameworks, generated structured comparison with tables
2. **Restart 1-8**: Refined through 8 iterations, reviewing Agent 1's code-based analysis and incorporating insights
3. **Final answer (agent2.8)**: Comprehensive multi-layered comparison emphasizing architectural differences

**Key v0.0.28 improvement**: AG2's code execution capabilities brought a programmatic, data-driven approach to information gathering, complementing Gemini's web search capabilities within the same consensus workflow.

#### The Voting Pattern

**Cross-Framework Voting Dynamics:**

The coordination table shows sophisticated voting behavior:

1. **Agent 1 (AG2) voting behavior:**
   - Voted for Agent 2's answers initially (agent2.1, agent2.3, agent2.4) across multiple iterations
   - Later voted for its own refined answer (agent1.2) after multiple improvements
   - Reasoning: "Concise, accurate bullet-point comparison focused on differences"

2. **Agent 2 (Gemini) voting behavior:**
   - Consistently voted for Agent 2's own refined answer (agent2.8)
   - Reasoning: "Excellent, multi-layered comparison"

3. **Winner selection:**
   - Agent 1 (AG2 agent) selected as winner with answer agent1.2
   - Both agents voted for themselves in final iterations, but Agent 1's answer was selected as the winner

**Key v0.0.28 improvement**: AG2 agents can fully participate in MassGen's voting mechanism, demonstrating that external framework agents understand and contribute to consensus building.

#### Final Results & Answer Comparison

**Winner: Agent 1 (ag2_coder) - AG2 AssistantAgent**

### Core Distinction: Orchestration vs. Parallel Refinement

The fundamental difference between AG2 and MassGen lies in their purpose and agent collaboration model. AG2 is a broad, general-purpose framework for **building and orchestrating** complex, often sequential, workflows with multiple specialized agents. In contrast, MassGen is a specialized system designed for multiple agents to tackle the **same task in parallel** to generate a single, higher-quality result through debate and consensus.

*   **Analogy for AG2:** Think of it as an **Agent Operating System**. It manages a team of specialists (like a planner, a coder, and a reviewer), each handling a different part of a larger, multi-step process.
*   **Analogy for MassGen:** Think of it as a **Parallel Study Group**. A group of diverse students simultaneously tackles the same difficult problem, sharing their approaches and critiquing each other's work to arrive at the best possible answer.

### Comparison Summary

| Feature | AG2 (ag2ai/ag2) | MassGen (Leezekun/MassGen) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

**Key Features of AG2:**
*   **Workflow Orchestration**: Its primary strength is creating complex, conversational workflows where specialized agents interact to automate a process.
*   **Conversable Agents**: The framework is built on the concept of a "Conversable Agent," a flexible building block for creating agents that can communicate, use LLMs, and interact with tools or humans.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop**: It features strong, built-in support for human oversight, allowing for systems that blend autonomous speed with expert human judgment.
*   **Broad Applicability**: Its general-purpose nature makes it suitable for a wide range of use cases, from automated coding to supply chain optimization and complex Q&A systems.

**Best for:** Building applications that require multiple specialized agents to collaborate through a defined, multi-step process to automate a complex task.

### **MassGen: The Parallel Debate for High-Quality Results**

Inspired by the methodologies of advanced AI, MassGen's core idea is not to divide a task into sequential parts, but to have multiple, diverse agents tackle the same task simultaneously. They work in parallel, observe each other's work, and refine their own approaches to converge on the best possible answer through a process of debate and consensus.

**Key Features of MassGen:**
*   **Parallel Problem-Solving**: MassGen assigns a task to multiple AI agents who work in parallel, fostering a collaborative and iterative environment to find the best solution.
*   **Convergence and Refinement**: The system is designed for agents to share insights and debate solutions, intelligently detecting when they have reached a consensus on the best output.
*   **Diverse Model Support**: It is designed to leverage multiple different LLMs and providers (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, Grok) at the same time to harness their complementary strengths.
*   **Enhanced Solution Quality**: The main goal is to achieve a superior, high-quality result for a single complex task by leveraging the diverse reasoning capabilities of multiple AI models working in tandem.

**Best for:** Generating the highest quality output for a single, complex request by harnessing the diverse reasoning power of multiple top-tier LLMs working in parallel.

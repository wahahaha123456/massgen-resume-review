## ✅ v0.1.97 - Application-Layer Permission Engine (Completed)

**Released:** June 12, 2026

### Features
- **Permission engine (opt-in `permissions:` block)**: a composite `PreToolUse` pipeline in `massgen/permissions/` — a non-overridable **hardline** blocklist (`hardline.py`: catastrophic patterns like `rm -rf /`, fork bombs, raw-disk `dd`), a declarative **`action(target)` rule layer** (`rules.py`: `command`/`read_file`/`write_file`/`read_url`/`mcp`/`*`, deny-wins across scopes), and a **blast-radius `RiskClassifier`** that tiers by what the call does (egress/force-push/publish/privilege → high; reads/in-workspace edits → low). An explicit rule suppresses the risk-ask, so rules + risk live in one hook
- **Approval round-trip**: the `base_with_custom_tool_and_mcp` chokepoint resolves an `ask` via a pluggable `ApprovalProvider` — automation **policy** (`risk-based` default / `deny-all` / `allow-all`) or **file** request/response handshake for headless/remote (fail-closed on timeout)
- **Roles, audit & guards**: per-agent `role` presets (`read-only`/`researcher` deny writes+shell, also empty the agent's SRT writable set), an append-only JSONL **`ApprovalLedger`**, a runaway-loop **`ApprovalBudget`** (opt-in `max_consecutive_auto`), and `always`-grant persistence to `settings.local.json`
- **Channel-based guardrail system prompt** (`PermissionGuardrailSection`, injected only when the engine is active): follow the guardrails, don't circumvent a denial, surface-and-ask — while keeping `ask` a sanctioned path. Denied tool calls now render as **first-class failed tool events** (with the command) in the TUI/WebUI timeline
- **Backend parity guard**: native backends (`claude_code`, `codex`) lack the framework chokepoint, so a `permissions:` block there is reported **INACTIVE** instead of silently inert

### Notes
- All items landed under TDD (tests first, confirmed red, then green); presence-gated so a config with no `permissions:` block is 100% unchanged.
- Live-verified (automation, `gemini-3-flash-preview`): all three chokepoint branches end-to-end + audit ledger; denied calls emitting real `tool_start`/`tool_complete(error)` events.
- **Honest scope**: the prompt + regex classifier are best-effort *alignment* — a model evaded the egress classifier via `\c\u\r\l` / `python urllib`, confirming the OS sandbox (v0.1.96) is the load-bearing enforcement. Follow-ups in `docs/dev_notes/permissions_p2_followups.md` (limitations) and OS-layer egress enforcement.
- Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) remain deferred to v0.1.98.

## ✅ v0.1.96 - OS-Level Agent Sandboxing (Completed)

**Released:** June 10, 2026

### Features
- **SRT Sandbox Mode (`command_line_execution_mode: srt`)**: a third command-execution mode alongside `local`/`docker`. `SrtManager` (`massgen/filesystem_manager/_srt_manager.py`) wraps agent command/code execution in Anthropic's [sandbox-runtime](https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime) (bubblewrap on Linux, Seatbelt on macOS), deriving per-agent OS-enforced filesystem + network isolation from the **same** `PathPermissionManager` policy as the app layer (defense in depth). Both the command-line MCP and the filesystem-tools MCP servers are OS-wrapped; npx/npm launchers auto-skip and keep their app-layer protection
- **Configurable Read Confinement (`command_line_srt_read_mode`, default `confined`)**: `confined` denies all of `$HOME` and re-allows only the workspace + context (system paths stay readable); `strict` denies `/` and allows only managed + a system baseline; `open` allows-all minus a secret denylist. `command_line_srt_allow_read` widens it per config. Network is deny-all by default — each allowlisted domain is an explicit capability grant
- **Hardened Permission Hook**: `_validate_no_path_arg_escapes` walks the full tool-args tree (nested dicts + lists) and denies any value resolving outside managed areas, closing prior fail-open gaps (unrecognized key, list-valued paths, `move`/`copy` source pointing outside) without false positives
- **Parity & Safety**: native-sandbox backends (Codex `--full-auto`, Claude Code) degrade `srt`→`local` to avoid nested-sandbox hangs; subagents inherit the parent's SRT settings (parity with Docker)

### Notes
- All items landed under TDD, with a 15-vector adversarial escape suite and an adversarially-verified multi-agent pre-merge review.
- Default-off, one-knob opt-in; current behavior unchanged unless a config sets `command_line_execution_mode: srt`.
- Live-verified (macOS 15.7, srt 1.0.0) across OpenRouter, OpenAI Responses, and Gemini backends.
- Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) remain deferred to v0.1.97.

## ✅ v0.1.95 - Steering Improvements (Completed)

**Released:** June 8, 2026

### Features
- **Programmatic Steering Inbox (`--inbox-dir`)**: `send_steering_message()` (`massgen/steering.py`) writes a `msg_*.json` to a caller-known inbox; `RuntimeInboxPoller` routes it through `RuntimeInputDelivery` to the same `set_pending_input` chokepoint the TUI/WebUI use, so `--automation` and any UI-less caller can inject mid-stream human input (with one/subset/broadcast targeting)
- **Interrupt-and-Resume Steering (Codex & Antigravity)**: steering mid-turn kills the in-flight turn and resumes (`codex exec resume <session> <prompt>` / `agy --continue -p <prompt>`) instead of waiting for a round boundary; Antigravity promotes pre-interrupt scratch deliverables first
- **MCP-Server-Hook Payload IPC (Antigravity, codex parity)**: `write_post_tool_use_hook()` / `read_unconsumed_hook_content()` with `expires_at`-guarded payloads consumed by the MCP middleware, enabling the backend-agnostic per-chunk injection flush for `agy`
- **Antigravity `--model` wired through**: the resolved model label is now actually passed to `agy`

### Bug Fixes
- `--inbox-dir` honored for resumed sessions (`--session-id` / config `session_id` / `--continue`), not just new sessions
- `read_unconsumed_hook_content()` honors `expires_at` so stale steering can't trigger an unexpected interrupt/resume (both backends)
- Watcher-cleanup failures logged at debug instead of swallowed (both backends)
- Round-1 native-hook gap closed (Antigravity `hook_dir` set at orchestrator fetch time); middleware `hook_dir` coerced to `Path`

### Notes
- All items landed under TDD, with deterministic coverage plus opt-in live-fire tests.
- Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) remain deferred to v0.1.97.

## ✅ v0.1.94 - Parallelism Hardening (Engineering Health) (Completed)

**Released:** June 5, 2026

### Features
- **Snapshot Copy Off the Event Loop**: `FilesystemManager.copy_snapshots_to_temp_workspace` offloads its blocking `rmtree`/`copytree`/scrub to a worker thread via `asyncio.to_thread`, so one agent's snapshot copy no longer serializes every other agent's streaming
- **Immutable, Versioned Snapshots**: snapshots publish to `<base>/.versions/<id>/v<N>` with an atomically-repointed symlink; readers `acquire`/refcount the current version for the duration of their copy (new `SnapshotVersionStore`), eliminating the read-during-write race the off-loop copy would otherwise expose
- **Concurrency Correctness**: fixed lost peer-answer revisions (R1), lost background-subagent results (R2/R3), leaked background trace tasks on cleanup (R4), and a cancel-without-await teardown (R5)
- **Worktree-Isolation Degradation Surfaced (D2)**: an invalid `emit_status(status=…)` kwarg had its `TypeError` swallowed, silencing the signal entirely
- **Unified Mid-Stream Injection (A1)**: the two ~150-line per-backend `get_injection_content` closures collapsed into one `build_midstream_injection(..., native=)`; the background-wait interrupt provider was deduplicated, removing backend-parity drift

### Notes
- Engineering-health release: no per-backend functionality changes (parity principle); all items landed under TDD with cost-free simulation.
- Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) remain deferred to v0.1.95.

## ✅ v0.1.93 - CLI Package Decomposition & Pydantic Config Migration (Completed)

**Released:** June 3, 2026

### Features
- **CLI Package Decomposition**: The monolithic `massgen/cli.py` (12,206 lines) was split into an 18-module `massgen/cli/` package with a facade that preserves the public import surface; the ~886-line Textual per-turn handler was extracted into a dependency-injected function
- **Pydantic Config Migration**: Config classes migrated to `pydantic.dataclasses` (type validation on construction) with `Literal`-typed modes in `massgen/config_modes.py` that `config_validator` derives from — closing a real validator-drift bug
- **Single-Source Exclusion Lists**: The two hand-duplicated "params never forwarded to provider APIs" lists now derive from one frozenset, locked by a regression test
- **Dead Code Removal**: Deleted ~8,700 lines of unreferenced legacy `v1`/`prototype` code that was shipping in the wheel
- **Tooling**: Fixed the broken coverage gate, enabled a no-assert test guard, enforced `uv.lock` in CI, and re-enabled type checking via an incremental mypy ratchet
- **Fixes**: Concurrent-run log isolation (MAS-274), a config default regression, and logged (not silent) backend tool-arg parsing

### Notes
- Internal-quality release: runtime behavior is preserved.
- Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) remain deferred to v0.1.94.

## ✅ v0.1.92 - Orchestrator Collaborator Refactor & Parallel Search MCP (Completed)

**Released:** June 1, 2026

### Features
- **Orchestrator Collaborator Extraction**: `orchestrator.py` dropped from 21,599 to 8,574 lines by extracting 49 lazy collaborators into `massgen/orchestrator_collaborators/`
- **Stable Delegator Surface**: Public methods remain available through thin delegators, preserving existing internal and external call sites
- **Textual Display Cleanup**: Provider/model helpers, terminal capability probing, and widget-debug helpers moved out of `textual_terminal_display.py` into focused sibling modules
- **Parallel Web Search MCP**: New `parallel_search` MCP registry entry and `massgen/configs/tools/web-search/parallel_search_example.yaml` for Parallel's hosted Search MCP server
- **Refactor Roadmap**: `docs/dev_notes/orchestrator_refactor_roadmap.md` documents remaining high-risk follow-up extraction work
- **Tests**: 77 new characterization cases cover orchestrator and Textual display contracts, with existing integration/unit seams repointed to the collaborators

### Notes
- Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) remain deferred to v0.1.94.

## ✅ v0.1.91 - Config Reliability & Hook Safety (Completed)

**Released:** May 27, 2026

### Features
- **Centralized Config Wiring**: `CoordinationConfig.from_dict()` and `TimeoutConfig.from_dict()` now own YAML parsing for coordination and timeout settings, while `AgentConfig.apply_orchestrator_config()` owns top-level orchestrator runtime field application
- **Config Drift Detection**: Unknown `orchestrator.coordination.*`, top-level `orchestrator.*`, and `timeout_settings.*` keys now produce validation warnings, and strict config validation treats those warnings as release-blocking
- **Checklist Runtime Controls**: `max_checklist_calls_per_round` and `checklist_first_answer` now flow through the centralized top-level orchestrator runtime helper instead of being validation-only settings
- **Native Hook Permission Safety**: Gemini CLI and Codex standalone hook scripts now enforce more-specific managed paths and protected paths before broader writable parents
- **Claude Hook Contract Alignment**: Claude Code native hook tests and docs now match the SDK-native `additionalContext` injection format
- **Tests**: New parser/validator parity coverage and native hook regression tests protect these release-critical paths

### Notes
- Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) remain deferred to v0.1.94.

## ✅ v0.1.90 - Discriminative Criteria Refinements & Checklist Calibration (Completed)

**Released:** May 25, 2026

### Features
- **Discriminative-Power Pruning**: Bootstrap criteria now compute per-criterion score spread across agents and demote low-spread criteria to `stretch`, keeping low-signal checks visible without letting them act as hard gates
- **Criterion Feedback Loop**: Checklist reasoning is extracted into a next-round feedback memo so agents see exactly which criterion gaps to address
- **Position-Bias Calibration**: Candidate answer ordering is rotated per scoring agent, distributing the primacy slot and reducing self-preference
- **Checklist Gate Unification**: `ChecklistGate.from_budget(...)` derives effective threshold, required-true count, and confidence cutoff from one 0-10 scale
- **Shared Score Utilities**: `massgen/score_utils.py` centralizes score extraction and per-agent score-shape detection across checklist, quality, and bootstrap paths
- **Fast-Iteration Config Updates**: Fast-iteration examples now default to local command execution and current Gemini/Codex/Antigravity pairings
- **Tests**: New coverage for discriminative pruning, criterion feedback, position-bias calibration, score parsing, and checklist server behavior

### Notes
- Discriminative Criteria Refinements from the roadmap landed in this release.
- Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) remain deferred to v0.1.94.

## ✅ v0.1.89 - Antigravity CLI Full Integration & Hardening (Completed)

**Released:** May 22, 2026 | PRs: [#1099](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1099)

### Features
- **Workflow-Mode Parity**: Antigravity now mirrors Gemini CLI's workflow handling for `new_answer` / `vote`, including `new_answer_only` rounds, post-evaluation guards, and duplicate workflow-call suppression
- **Auth and Binary Health Checks**: The backend verifies `agy --version` and fails fast when neither API-key auth nor cached Google OAuth credentials are available
- **Workspace Write Reliability**: MassGen passes `--add-dir <cwd>` and creates a workspace-root `.antigravitycli/` marker so agy writes files into the shared workspace instead of hidden scratch directories
- **Native Hooks**: Antigravity native hooks now use standalone `hooks.json` plus `enableJsonHooks`
- **Prompt Guardrails**: `TaskContextSection` hides `spawn_subagents` when subagents are disabled, preventing phantom subagent MCP calls in multimodal-only runs
- **Tests**: `massgen/tests/test_antigravity_cli_backend.py` and `massgen/tests/test_system_prompt_sections.py` cover health checks, auth, workspace anchoring, hooks, workflow filtering, and prompt affordance gating

### Notes
- This completes the follow-up Antigravity integration pass introduced in v0.1.88.
- Discriminative Criteria Refinements landed in v0.1.90; Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) remain deferred to v0.1.94.

---

## ✅ v0.1.88 - Antigravity CLI Backend (Completed)

**Released:** May 20, 2026 | PRs: [#1097](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1097)

### Features
- **Antigravity CLI Backend**: New `antigravity_cli` backend wraps Google's `agy` binary as a MassGen backend
- **Workspace-Local Isolation**: Antigravity config and MCP settings are written under `.antigravity/` in the run workspace via `--gemini_dir`, avoiding global `~/.gemini/` mutation
- **MCP Config Translation**: MassGen MCP server entries are translated to Antigravity's schema, including `serverUrl` for HTTP servers
- **Native Hook Adapter**: `AntigravityCLINativeHookAdapter` reuses Gemini CLI hook behavior for Antigravity's compatible hook protocol
- **Example Configs**: `massgen/configs/providers/antigravity/antigravity_cli_local.yaml` and `massgen/configs/features/fast_iteration_gemini_antigravity.yaml`
- **Tests**: `massgen/tests/test_antigravity_cli_backend.py` covers command construction, config isolation, MCP schema, workflow JSON envelopes, Docker/API-key constraints, hook wiring, and env passthrough

### Notes
- Follow-up Antigravity hardening landed in v0.1.89; Discriminative Criteria Refinements landed in v0.1.90; Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) remain deferred to v0.1.94.

## ✅ v0.1.87 - Documentation: Framework Comparisons & `llms.txt` (Completed)

**Released:** May 15, 2026 | PRs: [#1094](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1094)

### Features
- **Framework Comparison Pages**: Three new "MassGen vs ..." pages — `crewai.rst`, `langgraph.rst`, `autogen.rst` — under `docs/source/reference/comparisons/`, positioning MassGen against each framework's coordination shape
- **`llms.txt` Index**: Curated [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org)-spec index published at the docs site root via Sphinx `html_extra_path`
- **`llms-full.txt` Corpus**: Concatenated full-docs dump (~1 MB, 59 files), generated by a Sphinx `build-finished` hook in `conf.py`
- **Docs Landing Page Update**: "How Does MassGen Compare?" now lists all four comparisons (LLM Council + the three new ones); parent `comparisons.rst` drops "coming soon" and gains a toctree
- **README Pointers**: One-line pointer in `README.md` / `README_PYPI.md` directing AI agents to `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt`
- **`bootstrap_subagent` Single-Shot Fix**: `Orchestrator._run_bootstrap_discriminator_step` passes `refine=False` to `spawn_subagent` — the canonical knob `SubagentManager` respects at the orchestrator level (the orchestrator's `max_new_answers_per_agent: 3` default was shadowing coordination-dict overrides)

### Notes
- Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) ultimately carried forward to v0.1.94.
- Closes [#1082](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/1082) (`llms.txt` + `llms-full.txt`) and [#1083](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/1083) (CrewAI / LangGraph / AutoGen comparison pages).

## ✅ v0.1.86 - `bootstrap_subagent` Discriminator + Codex MCP Approval Fix (Completed)

**Released:** May 13, 2026 | PRs: [#1090](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1090)

### Features
- **`bootstrap_subagent` Variant (fully functional)**: The dedicated critic-driven criteria path now runs an in-process LLM discriminator between rounds. The critic reads the task and each agent's latest answer, emits `proposed_criteria` as JSON, and merges them into the accumulator for the next round's checklist
- **Answer-Snapshot Gate**: The discriminator runs once per unique answer snapshot, avoiding repeated critiques when the answer set has not changed
- **Session-End Drain**: Late stdio JSONL criteria emissions are drained before final presentation so they are not stranded after the final checklist resolution pass
- **Codex MCP Approval Fix**: Codex workspaces now write both non-interactive approval bypasses needed for external MCP tool calls under `codex exec`
- **Tests**: Bootstrap criteria coverage expanded to 35 tests; Codex workspace approval policy coverage added across approval modes

### Notes
- Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) remain deferred to v0.1.87.

---

## ✅ v0.1.85 - Discriminative Criteria Emergence (`criteria_mode`) (Completed)

**Released:** May 11, 2026

### Features
- **`bootstrap_inline` Variant (fully functional)**: Agents emit `proposed_criteria` alongside `submit_checklist`; proposals are deduped, FIFO-capped, persisted to `bootstrap_criteria_accumulator.json`, and merged into the next round's checklist via `EvaluationSection`. Works on all backends with checklist tool support — SDK (Claude Code) via in-process schema, stdio backends via a JSONL emission channel
- **`bootstrap_subagent` Variant (wired, LLM step deferred)**: Same accumulator pipeline; in-process LLM discriminator pass queued for v0.1.86
- **New Module**: `massgen/bootstrap_criteria.py` with `merge_proposals`, `augment_with_accumulator`, `is_bootstrap_mode`, `validate_criteria_mode`
- **Config Fields**: `CoordinationConfig.{criteria_mode, bootstrap_max_per_agent_per_round, bootstrap_max_total}`
- **Anti-Goodhart by construction**: Criteria come from observed gaps, not priors
- **Example Configs**: `massgen/configs/coordination/{bootstrap_inline_criteria,bootstrap_subagent_criteria}.yaml`
- **Tests**: 30 new tests in `massgen/tests/test_bootstrap_criteria.py` (476 lines) covering merge/dedup/cap, config validation, augmentation, rendering gating, and round-N → round-N+1 propagation

### Notes
- Originally-planned Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) deferred to v0.1.86.

---

## ✅ v0.1.84 - TUI Consensus Map (Completed)

**Released:** May 8, 2026 | PRs: [#1085](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1085)

### Features
- **TUI Consensus Map**: Compact visual map below the agent status ribbon during multi-agent runs that summarizes coordination state without replacing the timeline
- **Visibility Logic**: Hidden on welcome screen and single-agent runs; only shown when more than one active agent is coordinating
- **Event-Driven State**: Map state updates from existing coordination events (`answer_submitted`, `vote`, `agent_stopped`, `winner_selected`, `final_presentation_start`, `agent_restart`, `phase_change`, `context_received`) without backend schema changes
- **Direct-Callback Fallback**: Map remains accurate even when direct TUI callbacks update agent status or votes outside the unified event pipeline
- **OpenSpec Coverage**: Full change proposal, scenarios, and tasks under `openspec/changes/add-tui-consensus-map/`

### Notes
- Originally-planned Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) deferred to v0.1.85.

---

## ✅ v0.1.83 - In-Session Standalone Checkpoint MCP Integration (Completed)

**Released:** May 1, 2026 | PRs: [#1079](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1079)

### Features
- **In-Session Standalone Checkpoint**: Standalone checkpoint MCP server (originally for external hosts like Claude Code) can now run *inside* a normal MassGen single-agent session, exposing the richer `init` + `checkpoint` tools backed by its own reviewer team
- **`coordination.standalone_checkpoint` Config Block**: New YAML block with `enabled`, `team_config`, `mode` (`generate` | `verify`), `single_checkpoint`, `include_workspace_context`; invalid `mode` falls back to `generate` with a warning
- **Single-Agent-Only Affordance Gating**: Multi-agent parents skip the standalone server with a warning — the standalone server runs its own reviewer panel
- **Enhanced Checkpoint Tool Card**: TUI tool card visualization distinguishes primary checkpoint operations from system tasks
- **Example Configs**: `massgen/configs/checkpoint/standalone_mcp/{fast_iteration,reviewers}.yaml`

### Notes
- Originally-planned Checkpoint Safety Mode ([#1026](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/1026)) and Round Evaluator over-indexing fix ([#994](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/994)) deferred to a future release.

## ✅ v0.1.82 - TUI Copy Mode & Checkpoint Quality Improvements (Completed)

**Released:** April 29, 2026 | PRs: [#1076](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1076)

### Features
- **TUI Copy Mode**: New `Ctrl+Shift+S` toggle releases terminal mouse tracking so users can drag-select text natively; auto-restores on exit
- **Checkpoint Workspace Context**: New `include_workspace_context` config option for standalone checkpoint MCP server (default off)
- **Checkpoint Plan Quality Criteria**: Mode-aware quality criteria with selective branch depth scoring for single vs. multi-checkpoint modes
- **Single-Checkpoint Agent Recovery**: Detailed recovery workflow for agents when a plan branch resolves to `terminate`
- **TUI Visual Polish**: Ribbon dividers changed from `│` to `·`

### Notes
- Cloud Modal MVP deferred from v0.1.82 to v0.1.83.

---

## ✅ v0.1.81 - Multi-Region Circuit Breaker Failover (Phase 6) (Completed)

**Released:** April 27, 2026 | PRs: [#1072](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1072)

### Features
- **Multi-Region Failover**: LLM circuit breaker fails over to backup regions when the primary trips OPEN, with automatic recovery when the primary returns to healthy
- **Production-Grade Resilience**: Builds on Phase 4 (distributed store) and Phase 5 (adaptive thresholds) for full multi-region resilience

### Notes
- Cloud Modal MVP originally planned for v0.1.81 — deferred again to v0.1.82.

---

## ✅ v0.1.80 - Adaptive Circuit Breaker & Checkpoint Modes (Completed)

**Released:** April 22, 2026 | PRs: [#1065](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1065), [#1070](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1070)

### Features
- **Circuit Breaker Adaptive Thresholds (Phase 5)**: Self-tuning thresholds that respond to each backend's actual failure patterns
- **Single Checkpoint Mode**: New standalone checkpoint mode — no recheckpointing within a single operation
- **Draft Plan Verify Mode**: New standalone checkpoint mode — verify a draft plan before executing

### Notes
- Cloud Modal MVP originally planned for v0.1.80 — deferred again to v0.1.81.

---

## ✅ v0.1.79 - Fast Mode Speed Control & Broader Checkpoint Framing (Completed)

**Released:** April 20, 2026

### Features
- **Better Fast Mode Options**: New options to control coordination speed — fine-grained speed vs. quality tradeoff
- **Broader Checkpoint Framing**: Checkpoint mode framing broadened from safety-only to high-stakes and coordinated phases
- **Checkpoint Instructions Clarity**: More clarity in trust settings for checkpoint agents

### Notes
- Cloud Modal MVP originally planned for v0.1.79 — deferred again to v0.1.80.

---

## ✅ v0.1.78 - Circuit Breaker Distributed Store (Phase 4) (Completed)

**Released:** April 17, 2026 | PRs: [#1061](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1061)

### Features
- **Pluggable CB state store**: The LLM circuit breaker's state is now held behind a `CircuitBreakerStore` Protocol and can be shared across workers and processes. Default (`store=None`) preserves single-process behavior.
- **In-memory CB state store**: Thread-safe, zero-dependency implementation for single-process deployments and tests.
- **Redis-backed CB state store**: Distributed implementation via optional `redis>=4.0`; install with `pip install massgen[redis-store]`.
- **Atomic CB transitions**: `atomic_record_failure` / `atomic_record_success` make CB state transitions linearizable when workers race on the same upstream backend.

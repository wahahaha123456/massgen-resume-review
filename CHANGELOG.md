## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.97] - 2026-06-12

### Theme: Application-Layer Permission Engine

A layered, **fully opt-in** permission system for agent tool calls — the application-layer companion to v0.1.96's OS sandbox. When a `permissions:` block is present, every tool call flows through a hardline catastrophic-command floor, a declarative `allow/ask/deny` rule layer, and a blast-radius risk classifier, resolving to allow / **ask** / deny. An `ask` routes through a pluggable approval provider: an automation policy (`risk-based` / `deny-all` / `allow-all`) or a file request/response handshake for headless/remote approval. Approvals are recorded in an append-only audit ledger; per-agent **role presets** (e.g. `read-only`) scope each agent and also empty the SRT writable set as an OS backstop. A channel-based **guardrail system prompt** tells the model to follow blocks and surface-and-ask rather than circumvent — while keeping `ask` a sanctioned path. **Presence-gated**: a config with no `permissions:` block is 100% unchanged. All items landed under TDD (tests first, confirmed red, then green), with live verification across automation runs. **Honest scope**: the prompt + regex classifier are best-effort *alignment*, not enforcement — the OS sandbox (v0.1.96) remains the load-bearing control (see `docs/dev_notes/permissions_p2_followups.md`).

### Added
- **Permission engine (opt-in `permissions:` block)**: composite `PreToolUse` pipeline in `massgen/permissions/` — a non-overridable hardline blocklist (`hardline.py`, catastrophic patterns like `rm -rf /`, fork bombs, raw-disk `dd`), a declarative `action(target)` rule layer (`rules.py`: `command`/`read_file`/`write_file`/`read_url`/`mcp`/`*`, **deny-wins** across scopes), and a blast-radius `RiskClassifier` (`risk_classifier.py`: tiers by what the call *does* — egress/force-push/publish/privilege → high, reads/in-workspace edits → low). An explicit rule suppresses the risk-ask, so rules + risk live in one hook.
- **Approval round-trip**: the `base_with_custom_tool_and_mcp` chokepoint resolves an `ask` via a pluggable `ApprovalProvider` — `PolicyApprovalProvider` → automation default (`risk-based` ships default; high denied with reason, low/medium allowed) and `FileApprovalProvider` → `req_*.json`/`resp_*.json` handshake for headless/remote approval (Slack bot, `/approve <id>`, …). Both are live-verified and fail-closed on timeout.
- **Per-agent role scoping**: `permissions.role` presets (`read-only`/`researcher` deny writes+shell; `read-write`/`implementer` fall through to rules+risk), merged with user rules deny-wins. A `read-only` role also empties the agent's SRT writable set (OS-layer backstop to the engine's write denials).
- **Audit ledger + runaway guard (`ledger.py`)**: `ApprovalLedger` writes one append-only JSONL line per approval decision (who/what/why/outcome, crash-safe). `ApprovalBudget` caps consecutive auto-approvals per agent (opt-in `max_consecutive_auto`; fail-closed past the cap, reset by any human decision).
- **`always`-grant persistence**: an operator's "Always" approval persists as a deduped `allow(...)` rule in `settings.local.json` and loads back as a merged scope next run (opt-out `persist_approvals: false`).
- **Channel-based guardrail system prompt**: `PermissionGuardrailSection` is injected into the system prompt only when the engine is active for that agent — follow the guardrails, don't circumvent a denial (no rewording/obfuscation/tool-swap), surface-and-ask instead; **`ask` is explicitly sanctioned, not a block**. Authority is established by channel (only the system prompt is authoritative; tool/file/web content never is) — no token needed.

### Changed
- **Denied tool calls render as first-class FAILED tool events**: the deny path now emits `tool_start` (with the attempted command/args) + `tool_complete(is_error=True, status="denied")` and the status line shows the command (`Denied ($ curl …): …`), so blocked calls appear in the TUI/WebUI timeline instead of only a transient status line.

### Fixed
- **Backend parity guard**: native backends (`claude_code`, `codex`) don't run the framework `PreToolUse` chokepoint, so a `permissions:` block there is reported **INACTIVE** at startup (loud warning) and inert hooks are skipped — preventing a false promise of enforcement.

### Tests
- New deterministic suites: `test_permissions_core.py`, `test_permission_rules.py`, `test_permission_hooks.py`, `test_permission_coordinator.py`, `test_approval_provider.py` / `test_file_approval_provider.py`, `test_approval_ledger.py`, `test_permissions_optional.py` (opt-in/presence gate + parity guard), `test_permission_persistence.py` (write↔load roundtrip + dedup), `test_permission_guardrail_prompt.py` (gating + content incl. ask-is-sanctioned), `test_permission_denied_tool_visibility.py` (start→error-complete events + command preview), plus SRT read-only backstop in `test_srt_manager.py` / `test_srt_filesystem_integration.py`.
- Live-verified (automation, `gemini-3-flash-preview`): all three chokepoint branches end-to-end (allow / deny-rule / ask→policy-deny + ledger), guardrail policy present in the real system message, denied calls emitting real `tool_start`/`tool_complete(error)` events with the command. Documented honest limitation: the model evaded the regex egress classifier via `\c\u\r\l` / `python urllib`, confirming the OS sandbox is the load-bearing control.

### Documentations, Configurations and Resources
- **New Configs**: `massgen/configs/tools/permissions/permission_engine.yaml` (risk-tiered approval + rule algebra), `per_agent_roles.yaml` (role scoping).
- **Design Notes**: `docs/dev_notes/permission_systems_research.md` (three-layer model), `docs/dev_notes/permissions_p2_followups.md` (limitations, manual-test gaps, OS-enforcement follow-up).

## [0.1.96] - 2026-06-10

### Theme: OS-Level Agent Sandboxing

Add a real OS-level execution sandbox for agents via Anthropic's [sandbox-runtime](https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime) (`srt`: bubblewrap on Linux, Seatbelt on macOS), and harden the existing application-layer permission hook against file-tool escapes. **Defense in depth by design**: the OS layer (`SrtManager`) and the app layer (`PathPermissionManager`) are derived from the *same* path policy and both stay active — SRT closes the shell escape hatch (e.g. `echo x > /etc/passwd`, which never goes through a file tool), the hardened hook closes file-tool escapes (`write_file`/`move`/`copy` to/from outside the workspace). Default-off, one-knob opt-in (`command_line_execution_mode: srt`); current behavior is unchanged unless a config turns it on. All items landed under TDD (tests written first, confirmed red, then green), plus live verification across multiple backends.

### Added
- **SRT sandbox mode (`command_line_execution_mode: srt`)**: a third command-execution mode alongside `local`/`docker`. `SrtManager` (`massgen/filesystem_manager/_srt_manager.py`) derives per-agent SRT settings from `PathPermissionManager.managed_paths` — `allowWrite` for writable paths, `denyWrite` for read-only/protected paths, **network deny-all by default** (allowlist is opt-in, documented as a capability grant), and a built-in secret-store read-deny baseline. Commands are wrapped as `srt --settings cfg sh -c '<cmd>'` (the `sh -c` form is required so `srt` does not consume the server's `--` separator). Both the command-line MCP and the filesystem-tools MCP servers are OS-wrapped (defense in depth); npx/npm launchers and the no-roots wrapper auto-skip wrapping (they need registry + `~/.npm` writes the sandbox blocks) and keep their app-layer protection. Example config: `massgen/configs/tools/filesystem/sandbox/srt_sandbox.yaml`.
- **Configurable SRT read confinement (`command_line_srt_read_mode`, default `confined`)**: SRT reads are allow-all by default, so `confined` denies all of `$HOME` (personal data, secrets, other projects) and re-allows only the workspace + context + temp paths while system paths stay readable so commands run; `strict` denies `/` and allows only managed paths + a system runtime baseline + extras; `open` allows-all reads minus a built-in secret denylist + extras. `command_line_srt_allow_read` widens the allow-list per config. New backend params `command_line_srt_network_allowed_domains` / `_deny_read` / `_allow_unix_sockets` / `_allow_read` / `_read_mode` added to the single-source exclusion list; `srt` added to the MCP executable allowlist. When the `fs_tools` profile OS-wraps a framework MCP server (`fastmcp run <massgen script>`), the framework's own read roots — the interpreter/site-packages (`sys.prefix`/`sys.base_prefix`), the `massgen` package source, and git's user config (`~/.gitconfig`, `~/.config/git`; git is core to the workspace snapshot model) — are re-allowed so the wrapped server can read its own code/runtime under `confined`/`strict` while user secrets stay denied. The agent's own `execution` profile is unaffected.
- **Subagent SRT inheritance**: subagents inherit the parent's `command_line_srt_*` settings (parity with Docker).

### Changed
- **Native-sandbox backends degrade `srt`→`local`**: `has_native_execution_sandbox()` (True for `codex` `--full-auto` and `claude_code`) prevents nested Seatbelt/Landlock hangs; the stored config is normalized so downstream raw reads see `local`.

### Fixed
- **Permission-hook hardening (`PathPermissionManager`)**: new `_validate_no_path_arg_escapes` — a key-agnostic scan that walks the full tool-args tree (nested dicts + lists) and denies any value resolving outside all managed areas. Closes the prior **fail-open** behavior (path under an unrecognized key, list-valued path, or `move`/`copy` `source` pointing outside the workspace) without false positives (non-path strings resolve harmlessly inside the workspace; content keys are skipped). Symlinks/`..` were already handled by `.resolve()`.

### Tests
- New deterministic suites: `test_srt_manager.py` (settings derivation, profiles, secret read-deny baseline, protected-path read+write deny, wrapping, availability guards), `test_srt_filesystem_integration.py` (command-line + fs-tools config wiring, `sh -c` wrap, npx / no-roots auto-skip, MCP-security validation), `test_srt_backend_degrade.py` (`srt`→`local` degrade for native-sandbox backends; API backends keep `srt`), `test_path_permission_hook_adversarial.py` (15 escape vectors — absolute/`..`/symlink/unrecognized-key/list/nested-dict/move-source/copy-source/read-exfil — plus false-positive guards), and `test_subagent_manager.py::TestSrtSettingsInheritance` (subagent inherits parent SRT settings).
- Live-verified (macOS 15.7, srt 1.0.0): standalone srt (allowed-write, out-of-scope write blocked, deny-all network blocked, secret read blocked); 3 API backends (OpenRouter/`chatcompletion`, OpenAI Responses, Gemini) with workspace write OK and out-of-workspace write/file-tool escape blocked; codex + srt and claude_code + srt degrade to local and complete via their native sandbox.

### Documentations, Configurations and Resources
- **New Config**: `massgen/configs/tools/filesystem/sandbox/srt_sandbox.yaml` — fully-commented SRT opt-in example with all read/network/socket knobs documented.

## [0.1.95] - 2026-06-08

### Theme: Steering Improvements

Extend mid-stream injection from a UI-only capability into a programmatic, headless one, and upgrade it from inject-at-next-boundary into true interrupt-and-resume for the CLI backends. A human (or any UI-less caller) can now drop guidance into an agent *while it is streaming* — over a file inbox in `--automation`, or through the MCP-middleware hook path — and Codex/Antigravity will interrupt the in-flight turn, fold the steering in, and resume rather than restart. No coordination-semantics changes; the injection chokepoint stays shared across TUI, WebUI, and the new headless path. All items landed under TDD (tests written first, confirmed red, then green), with deterministic coverage plus opt-in live-fire tests.

### Added
- **Programmatic mid-stream steering (`--inbox-dir`)**: `send_steering_message()` (`massgen/steering.py`) drops a `msg_*.json` into a caller-known inbox directory; the orchestrator's `RuntimeInboxPoller` routes it through `RuntimeInputDelivery.poll_runtime_inbox` to the same `set_pending_input` chokepoint the TUI (`_queue_human_input`) and WebUI (`broadcast_response`) already use. This makes mid-stream human input reachable from `--automation` and any UI-less caller, with per-message targeting (one agent / a subset / broadcast). The resolved inbox is announced as `RUNTIME_INBOX:` in automation output.
- **Mid-round interrupt-and-resume steering (Codex)**: when steering arrives mid-turn, the watcher kills the in-flight `codex exec` and resumes via `codex exec resume <session_id> <prompt>`, folding the steering in without waiting for a round boundary. Gated by `supports_interrupt_resume()` with `interrupt_poll_seconds` / `max_interrupts_per_turn` knobs.
- **Mid-round interrupt-and-resume steering (Antigravity)**: parity path for `agy` — kill the in-flight turn and resume with `agy --continue -p <prompt>`. Pre-interrupt scratch deliverables are promoted to the workspace first so work done before the interrupt isn't lost.
- **MCP-server-hook payload IPC for Antigravity (codex parity)**: `write_post_tool_use_hook()` / `read_unconsumed_hook_content()` with `expires_at`-guarded payloads, consumed by the MCP middleware (`massgen/mcp_tools/hook_middleware.py`), so the backend-agnostic per-chunk injection flush works for `agy` the same way it does for codex.

### Changed
- **Antigravity `--model` flag wired through for real**: the model label is now passed to `agy` (it was previously resolved but omitted from the command). Documented the per-round workspace reset and worktree-vs-workspace git-isolation modes in `docs/modules/worktrees.md` and `docs/source/user_guide/agent_workspaces.rst`.

### Fixed
- **`--inbox-dir` honored for all session modes**: the `MASSGEN_RUNTIME_INBOX_DIR` export lived inside the new-session branch of `main()`, so runs started with `--session-id`, a config `session_id`, or `--continue` silently dropped programmatic steering. Resolution is now hoisted into a `_resolve_runtime_inbox()` helper that runs before the session-mode branch.
- **Stale steering carryforward**: `read_unconsumed_hook_content()` (the round-end carryforward path) returned payloads without honoring `expires_at`, so a stale hook could trigger an unexpected interrupt/resume on the next round. It now drops expired payloads (fail-open on malformed values), mirroring the middleware. Applied to **both** `codex` and `antigravity_cli` for parity.
- **Swallowed watcher failures**: the interrupt/resume cleanup caught `(CancelledError, Exception)` and passed, masking real watcher bugs; non-cancellation failures are now logged at debug (`exc_info=True`). Both backends.
- **Round-1 native-hook gap (Antigravity)**: the native-hook adapter's `hook_dir` is now set at orchestrator fetch time, so first-round hooks are wired before the initial stream rather than lazily later.
- **Middleware `hook_dir` typing**: coerce the middleware `hook_dir` to `Path`, fixing the fastmcp-run stdio deployment path.

### Tests
- New deterministic suites: `test_steering_inbox.py` (writer → poller → chokepoint routing + `_resolve_runtime_inbox` export across all session modes), `test_codex_interrupt_resume.py` (resume-command + `expires_at` carryforward), `test_mcp_hook_middleware.py` (payload consumption + expiry), and `test_live_proc_io.py` (non-blocking subprocess stdout helper). Expanded `test_antigravity_cli_backend.py` with the MCP-hook IPC + interrupt-resume contract.
- New opt-in live-fire tests (`@pytest.mark.live_api`): `test_steering_live.py`, `test_codex_interrupt_resume_live.py`, `test_antigravity_interrupt_resume_live.py`, `test_codex_middleware_firing_live.py`, `test_codex_hook_firing_live.py`. Their stdout polling is non-blocking (`massgen/tests/_live_proc_io.py`) so a buffering child can't hang the test past its deadline.

### Documentations, Configurations and Resources
- **Updated Docs**: `docs/modules/worktrees.md` (per-round workspace reset, worktree vs. workspace isolation), `docs/modules/architecture.md` (agent statelessness note), `docs/source/user_guide/agent_workspaces.rst` (workspace initialization / state preservation).
- **New Config**: `massgen/configs/debug/codex_mcp_middleware_test.yaml` for exercising the Codex MCP-middleware injection path.
- **Updated Config**: `massgen/configs/providers/antigravity/antigravity_cli_local.yaml`.

## [0.1.94] - 2026-06-05

### Theme: Parallelism Hardening (Engineering Health)

Strengthen the orchestrator's parallel execution: move blocking snapshot work off the event loop so agents keep streaming concurrently, close the latent concurrency races that the previously-serialized copy had kept hidden, and finish the last refactor blocker. No per-backend functionality changes (parity principle). All items landed under TDD (tests written first, confirmed red, then green) with cost-free simulation (mock backends / real collaborator code, no LLM calls).

### Changed
- **Immutable, versioned snapshot storage**: each agent's snapshot path `<base>/<agent_id>` is now a symlink to an immutable version directory under `<base>/.versions/<agent_id>/v<N>`. `save_snapshot` (and the interrupted-turn partial save) publish a fresh version and atomically repoint the symlink rather than rewriting in place; the peer-context copy `acquire`s (refcounts) the current version for the duration of its offloaded copy. The symlink is transparent to all other readers, so the on-disk layout consumers see is unchanged. Coordinated by the new `SnapshotVersionStore` (`massgen/filesystem_manager/_snapshot_version_store.py`). On platforms without symlink support it falls back to a direct copy.
- **Snapshot copy moved off the event loop (B1)**: `FilesystemManager.copy_snapshots_to_temp_workspace` now runs its blocking `rmtree`/`copytree`/scrub on a worker thread via `asyncio.to_thread`, so one agent's snapshot copy no longer stalls every other agent's streaming.
- **Unified mid-stream injection (A1)**: the two ~150-line `get_injection_content` closures collapsed into a single `MidStreamInjectionHookInstaller.build_midstream_injection(..., native=)`; both hook-setup paths delegate, preserving the `update_context → refresh_checklist` side-effect order for both paths. The triplicated background-wait interrupt provider was likewise consolidated into one `_install_wait_interrupt_provider`.

### Fixed
- **Snapshot read-during-write race (B1 hardening)**: offloading the snapshot copy (above) removed the implicit event-loop serialization that kept a peer's `copytree` from overlapping an owner's in-place `rmtree`+rebuild of the same directory, which could surface `FileNotFoundError` or a torn snapshot. The versioned-snapshot scheme makes the read source immutable for the copy's duration, eliminating the race (including a concurrent-publisher GC edge case).
- **R1 — lost peer-answer revision**: the mid-stream injection path marked a peer "seen" by re-reading the live revision count after a yielding `await`, dropping a revision appended during the window. Revision counts captured at selection time are now threaded through `mark_seen_answer_revisions` / `register_injected_answer_updates`.
- **R2/R3 — lost background-subagent result**: a blind `pop(agent_id)` after the injection `await` discarded results appended during the window; consumption now removes only the consumed subagent ids.
- **R4 — leaked trace tasks on cleanup**: detached background trace-analyzer tasks are now cancelled before the pending-result flush.
- **R5 — cancel-without-await teardown**: `cancel_all_subagents` now awaits the cancellations so each task runs its `CancelledError` handler against the live registry before it is cleared.
- **D2 — worktree-isolation degradation never surfaced**: `_record_round_isolation_degraded` called `emit_status(status=…)`, which is not a valid parameter, so the `TypeError` was silently swallowed and the visible signal never fired; it now calls `emit_status(message=…, level="warning", agent_id=…)`.
- **D3 — changedoc enrichment made non-fatal** so a post-record failure cannot kill a valid-answer agent.
- **Interrupted-turn save over a published snapshot**: the partial save did `shutil.rmtree` on the (now symlinked) snapshot path, raising and silently dropping the snapshot; it now publishes a new version through the store.

### Tests
- New race/regression suites: `test_concurrency_race_fixes.py` (R1–R5, D2/D3), `test_snapshot_version_store.py` and `test_snapshot_versioned_save.py` (versioned snapshots incl. concurrent-publish-during-read and concurrent-publisher GC), `test_snapshot_copy_offload.py` (off-loop copy), `test_midstream_injection_unified.py` (cross-path effect-order equality), and `test_wait_interrupt_provider.py` (consolidated interrupt-provider contract).

## Recent Releases

**v0.1.96 (June 10, 2026)** - OS-Level Agent Sandboxing
Adds a real OS-level execution sandbox for agents via Anthropic's [sandbox-runtime](https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime) (`srt`) and hardens the application-layer permission hook against file-tool escapes. The new opt-in `command_line_execution_mode: srt` derives OS-enforced filesystem and network isolation from the same `PathPermissionManager` policy as MassGen's app layer, defaults network to deny-all, confines reads away from `$HOME` by default, degrades to native backend sandboxes where appropriate, and preserves subagent parity by inheriting parent SRT settings.

**v0.1.95 (June 8, 2026)** - Steering Improvements
Extends mid-stream injection into a programmatic, headless capability and upgrades it to true interrupt-and-resume for the CLI backends. A file inbox (`--inbox-dir`) lets `--automation` and any UI-less caller drop human guidance into a streaming agent through the same chokepoint the TUI/WebUI use; Codex and Antigravity now interrupt the in-flight turn and resume (`codex exec resume` / `agy --continue`) instead of waiting for a round boundary. Adds MCP-server-hook payload IPC for Antigravity (codex parity), wires the Antigravity `--model` flag, and fixes `--inbox-dir` for resumed sessions plus `expires_at`-guarded steering carryforward.

**v0.1.94 (June 5, 2026)** - Parallelism Hardening (Engineering Health)
Strengthens the orchestrator's parallel execution: moves the snapshot copy off the event loop so agents keep streaming concurrently — backed by immutable versioned snapshots that keep the off-loop copy safe — and closes latent concurrency races (lost peer-answer revisions, lost background-subagent results, leaked trace tasks, cancel-without-await teardown). Also unifies the mid-stream injection paths and surfaces worktree-isolation degradation. No per-backend functionality changes.

**v0.1.93 (June 3, 2026)** - CLI Package Decomposition & Pydantic Config Migration
Splits the monolithic `cli.py` into a focused `massgen/cli/` package, migrates the configuration classes to pydantic dataclasses with `Literal`-typed modes validated at construction, removes ~8.7k lines of dead legacy code, and hardens the test-signal and type-checking tooling (coverage gate, no-assert guard, `uv.lock` enforcement, and an incremental mypy ratchet). Internal-quality release with no runtime behavior changes.

**v0.1.92 (June 1, 2026)** - Orchestrator Collaborator Refactor & Parallel Search MCP
Refactors the monolithic orchestrator into 49 lazy collaborators with stable delegator call sites, splits focused TUI display helpers into sibling modules, adds characterization coverage for the extraction seams, and introduces a Parallel Web Search MCP registry entry plus runnable example config.

**v0.1.91 (May 27, 2026)** - Config Reliability & Hook Safety
Hardens release-critical configuration paths with centralized coordination, timeout, and orchestrator runtime parsing; strict unknown-key validation for typo detection; checklist runtime control wiring; and safer Gemini/Codex native hook path permission precedence.

**v0.1.90 (May 25, 2026)** - Discriminative Criteria Refinements & Checklist Calibration
Improves checklist-gated refinement quality with discriminative-power pruning, per-criterion feedback carried into the next round, position-bias counterbalancing, deterministic tie-breaking, a unified checklist gate on a single 0-10 scale, shared score parsing utilities, and fast-iteration config updates.

**v0.1.89 (May 22, 2026)** - Antigravity CLI Full Integration & Hardening
Completes the follow-up Antigravity integration pass with workflow-mode parity, early auth and binary health checks, workspace-root file writes via `--add-dir`, `.antigravitycli/` project-root anchoring, standalone `hooks.json` wiring with `enableJsonHooks`, prompt affordance gating for disabled subagents, and expanded regression coverage.

**v0.1.88 (May 20, 2026)** - Antigravity CLI Backend
Adds a new `antigravity_cli` backend wrapping Google's `agy` binary, with workspace-local `.antigravity/` isolation, MCP config emission using Antigravity's `serverUrl` schema, native-hook adapter support, OAuth/API-key auth handling, and new runnable configs for both single-agent and mixed Gemini + Antigravity runs.

**v0.1.87 (May 15, 2026)** - Documentation: Framework Comparisons & `llms.txt`
Documentation release adding three "MassGen vs ..." comparison pages (CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen/AG2), a curated `llms.txt` index plus full-corpus `llms-full.txt` dump (per [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org) spec), and small README/landing-page pointers so AI agents and crawlers can discover the docs. Also ships a one-line `refine=False` fix for the `bootstrap_subagent` discriminator that was being shadowed by the orchestrator's default `max_new_answers_per_agent`.

**v0.1.86 (May 13, 2026)** - `bootstrap_subagent` Discriminator + Codex MCP Approval Fix
Variant B (`criteria_mode: bootstrap_subagent`) is now functional: the orchestrator runs an in-process critic between rounds, merges critic-proposed criteria into the accumulator, and augments the next round's checklist. This release also fixes Codex MCP tool calls under `codex exec` by writing the approval bypasses needed for non-interactive runs.

**v0.1.85 (May 11, 2026)** - Discriminative Criteria Emergence (`criteria_mode`)
New `orchestrator.coordination.criteria_mode` option lets evaluation criteria emerge from observed gaps across rounds instead of being pre-authored. `bootstrap_inline` variant is fully functional on all backends with checklist tool support — agents emit `proposed_criteria` alongside `submit_checklist`, the accumulator dedupes/caps, and the next round's checklist is augmented automatically.

---

## [0.1.93] - 2026-06-03

### Changed
- **CLI Package Decomposition**: The monolithic `massgen/cli.py` (12,206 lines) was split into an 18-module `massgen/cli/` package with a facade `__init__` that preserves the public surface — `from massgen.cli import X` and `massgen.cli.X` continue to work unchanged. The ~886-line per-turn handler inside the Textual interactive loop was extracted into a module-level, dependency-injected function, dropping that loop from ~1,200 to ~284 lines.
- **Pydantic Config Migration**: The configuration classes (`AgentConfig`, `CoordinationConfig`, `TimeoutConfig`, `StepModeConfig`, `PromptImproverConfig`, and the persona/criteria/decomposer/subagent-orchestrator sub-configs) were migrated from plain dataclasses to `pydantic.dataclasses`, validating field types on construction while preserving `from_dict`/`to_dict`/`__post_init__` semantics. `pydantic>=2.0` is now a declared dependency.
- **Typed Mode Fields (Single Source of Truth)**: Mode fields (`write_mode`, `coordination_mode`, `novelty_injection`, `drift_conflict_policy`, `final_answer_strategy`, etc.) are now `Literal` types in `massgen/config_modes.py`, and `config_validator` derives its `VALID_*` sets from them via `get_args` so the validator can no longer drift from the config models.
- **Single-Source Exclusion Lists**: The two hand-duplicated 104/105 "params never forwarded to provider APIs" lists in `backend/base.py` and the API params handler now derive from one `frozenset` (`backend/_excluded_params.py`), with a regression test locking them in sync.

### Fixed
- **Concurrent-Run Log Isolation (MAS-274)**: The Textual interactive orchestration thread now inherits the per-run logging session via `contextvars.copy_context()`, so concurrent in-process runs no longer cross-contaminate logs and snapshot paths by falling back to the process-global session.
- **Stale Validator Set**: The validator's subagent runtime-mode set omitted `delegated` and would have rejected valid configs; deriving it from the `Literal` source of truth fixes this.
- **Config Default Regression**: `CoordinationConfig.from_dict` now drops `None` values so absent YAML keys fall back to field defaults (previously `write_mode` could become `None` instead of `"auto"`).
- **Backend Tool-Arg Logging**: The Response backend routes tool-call argument parsing through the shared normalizer, logging malformed payloads instead of silently dropping them to `{}`.

### Removed
- **Dead Legacy Packages**: Deleted ~8,700 lines of unreferenced legacy code (`massgen/v1`, `massgen/prototype`) that were being shipped in the wheel.

### Tests
- **Test-Signal Hardening**: Fixed the broken coverage configuration (`source` matched no real package), enabled `error::pytest.PytestReturnNotNoneWarning` so no-assert tests fail, and switched CI to enforce `uv.lock` (`uv sync --frozen`) with actionable `--tb=short`.
- **Incremental mypy Ratchet**: Re-enabled mypy (previously fully disabled) on a curated island of clean modules via `scripts/mypy_island.sh`, wired as a blocking pre-commit hook and CI gate, plus a non-blocking full-repo mypy job for visibility.
- Added `test_config_pydantic_validation.py`, `test_excluded_params_single_source.py`, and CLI helper/run-loop characterization suites; verified all 282 bundled configs still validate.

### Notes
- Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) remain deferred to a future release.
- This is an internal-quality release: behavior is preserved, with the focus on decomposing the CLI, giving configuration real type validation, and re-enabling type checking.

### Technical Details

## [0.1.92] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Parallel Web Search MCP**: Added a `parallel_search` MCP server registry entry and `massgen/configs/tools/web-search/parallel_search_example.yaml` for Parallel's hosted Search MCP server, supporting anonymous exploratory use and optional `PARALLEL_API_KEY` headers for higher rate limits.
- **Orchestrator Refactor Roadmap**: Added `docs/dev_notes/orchestrator_refactor_roadmap.md` to document the extraction sequence, lessons learned, and high-risk follow-up work left intentionally out of scope.
- **Characterization Coverage**: Added orchestrator and Textual terminal display characterization suites to pin public contracts and extraction seams before continuing deeper refactors.

### Changed
- **Orchestrator Collaborator Extraction**: `massgen/orchestrator.py` was reduced from 21,599 to 8,574 lines by extracting 49 lazy collaborators into `massgen/orchestrator_collaborators/`. Existing methods remain available through thin delegators so current internal and external call sites keep working.
- **Textual Terminal Display Cleanup**: Provider/model display helpers, terminal capability probing, and widget-debug helpers moved out of `textual_terminal_display.py` into focused sibling modules while preserving public imports.
- **Refactor Test Seams**: Existing monkeypatch and mock-stub tests were repointed to the collaborator locations without deleting tests or weakening assertions.

### Tests
- Added `massgen/tests/test_orchestrator_characterization.py` covering the orchestrator public contract and lazy collaborator access pattern.
- Added `massgen/tests/frontend/test_textual_terminal_display_characterization.py` covering Textual display public exports and helper extraction seams.
- Updated integration/unit coverage around broadcast hooks, restart/external tools, auto trace analysis, essential files, evaluator personas, and orchestrator units for the new collaborator seams.
- Verified targeted characterization and collaborator suites; ruff checks pass for the refactored orchestrator, collaborator package, and Textual display modules.

### Notes
- Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) remain deferred to v0.1.94.
- Remaining high-risk extraction work for MidStreamInjectionHookInstaller and streaming/coordination cores is documented for follow-up.

### Technical Details
- **Major Focus**: Shrink MassGen's orchestration core without changing behavior, making future coordination changes easier to isolate and review.
- **Key Commits**: `f9227eaf`, `a80281cb`, `efa4dd4c`, `b155a346`

## [0.1.91] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- **Config Drift Detection**: Config validation now warns on unknown `orchestrator.coordination.*`, top-level `orchestrator.*`, and `timeout_settings.*` keys so YAML typos are visible, and strict config validation treats those warnings as release-blocking.
- **Native Hook Permission Specificity**: Gemini CLI and Codex standalone hook scripts now enforce more-specific managed paths and protected paths before broader writable parents, preventing nested read-only paths from being masked by workspace-level write access.

### Changed
- **Centralized Config Wiring**: `CoordinationConfig.from_dict()` and `TimeoutConfig.from_dict()` now own YAML parsing for their surfaces, while `AgentConfig.apply_orchestrator_config()` owns top-level orchestrator runtime field application. CLI helpers remain as compatibility wrappers.
- **Checklist Runtime Controls**: `max_checklist_calls_per_round` and `checklist_first_answer` now flow through the centralized top-level orchestrator runtime helper instead of being validation-only settings.
- **Claude Native Hook Injection Contract**: Claude Code native hook tests and docs now match the adapter's SDK-native `additionalContext` injection format.

### Tests
- Added parser/validator parity coverage for coordination config fields, timeout settings, top-level orchestrator runtime fields, nested `standalone_checkpoint` aliases, documented YAML field coverage, and strict `scripts/validate_all_configs.py` behavior.
- Added native hook regression coverage for nested read-only path precedence, protected-path enforcement, and Claude Code `additionalContext` injection conversion.

### Notes
- Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) remain deferred to v0.1.94.

### Technical Details
- **Major Focus**: Make release-critical YAML configuration surfaces typo-resistant and parser-complete while hardening native hook path authorization.
- **Commits**: `3d25441e`, `47449c69`
- **Contributors**: @ncrispino, @HenryQi and the MassGen team

## [0.1.90] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- **Discriminative-Power Criteria Pruning**: Bootstrap criteria now compute per-criterion score spread across agents and demote low-spread, non-discriminative criteria to `stretch` while preserving a protected floor so the gate is not hollowed out.
- **Per-Criterion Feedback Loop**: Checklist score reasoning is extracted into a `<CRITERION FEEDBACK ...>` memo and queued into the next round, preserving the diagnostic gradient instead of reducing failures to numeric scores only.
- **Position-Bias Calibration**: Candidate answer presentation is deterministically rotated per scoring agent, distributing the primacy slot and placing the scorer's own answer last in its view.
- **Canonical Score Utilities**: New `massgen/score_utils.py` centralizes score extraction and per-agent score-shape detection across checklist, quality, and bootstrap-criteria paths.

### Changed
- **Checklist Gate Unification**: `ChecklistGate.from_budget(...)` derives effective threshold, required-true count, and confidence cutoff from one 0-10 scale, replacing drift-prone duplicate calculations.
- **Tie-Break Determinism**: Equal aggregate checklist scores now resolve independently of dictionary insertion order.
- **Backend Circuit-Breaker Config**: Shared `llm_circuit_breaker_*` kwarg parsing moved into `CustomToolAndMCPBackend`, removing duplicate backend implementations.
- **Fast-Iteration Configs**: Fast-iteration examples are updated for local command execution by default and current Gemini/Codex/Antigravity pairings.
- **Criteria Generation Fallback Signaling**: Generic fallback criteria now log and display as a warning so users can see when domain-specific generation failed.

### Tests
- `massgen/tests/test_discriminative_pruning.py` covers score-spread calculation, non-discriminative criterion demotion, protected floors, and orchestrator wiring.
- `massgen/tests/test_criterion_feedback.py` covers reasoning extraction from flat/per-agent score shapes and next-round feedback memo delivery.
- `massgen/tests/test_position_bias_calibration.py` covers deterministic tie-breaking and answer-order counterbalancing.
- `massgen/tests/test_score_utils.py` covers canonical score parsing behavior and per-agent score-shape detection.
- `massgen/tests/test_checklist_tools_server.py` updated for shared score parsing, feedback extraction, and checklist gate behavior.

### Notes
- Discriminative Criteria Refinements from the v0.1.90 roadmap landed in this release.
- Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) remain deferred to v0.1.94.

### Technical Details
- **Major Focus**: Make checklist-gated refinement a stronger optimization loop by improving the loss signal, reducing scoring bias, and preventing low-signal criteria from dominating later rounds.
- **Commits**: `96e9aff7`, `62cf4bf0`
- **Contributors**: @ncrispino, @HenryQi and the MassGen team

## [0.1.89] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **Antigravity Workflow-Mode Parity** ([#1099](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1099)): Ported Gemini CLI workflow-mode inference into `antigravity_cli`, including `new_answer_only` rounds when no candidate answers exist, post-evaluation phase guards, duplicate workflow-call suppression, and text-fallback parsing for `new_answer` / `vote`.
- **Auth and Binary Health Checks** ([#1099](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1099)): The backend now verifies `agy --version` at construction time and fails fast when neither API-key auth nor cached Google OAuth credentials are available.
- **Workspace Project Anchoring** ([#1099](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1099)): Antigravity runs now pre-create a workspace-root `.antigravitycli/` marker and pass `--add-dir <cwd>` so agy's project discovery and file writes stay inside the MassGen workspace.
- **Standalone Antigravity Hooks Wiring** ([#1099](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1099)): Native hooks now emit Antigravity's standalone `hooks.json` format and enable it through `settings.json` with `enableJsonHooks`.

### Changed
- **System Prompt Affordance Gating**: `TaskContextSection` now advertises subagent affordances only when subagents are actually enabled, preventing phantom subagent MCP calls in multimodal-only runs.
- **Antigravity Settings and Cleanup**: System-prompt `AGENTS.md` writes are atomic, transient hook files are restored, and `.antigravity/` / `.antigravitycli/` are ignored as runtime artifacts.
- **Antigravity Native Hook Adapter Docs**: Adapter comments now describe agy's `hooks.json` storage model instead of Gemini CLI's embedded `settings.json["hooks"]` model.

### Tests
- `massgen/tests/test_antigravity_cli_backend.py` expanded from initial backend coverage to 1,100+ lines covering health checks, authentication, workspace anchoring, `--add-dir`, hooks.json, workflow-mode filtering, duplicate tool-call suppression, multimodal prompt flattening, cancellation cleanup, and agent-id propagation.
- `massgen/tests/test_system_prompt_sections.py` adds regression coverage that `TaskContextSection` hides `spawn_subagents` when subagents are disabled and shows it only when enabled.

### Notes
- This release completes the follow-up Antigravity integration pass that v0.1.88 introduced as a first version.
- Discriminative Criteria Refinements landed in v0.1.90; Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) remain deferred to v0.1.94.

### Technical Details
- **Major Focus**: Make Antigravity CLI reliable in real MassGen coordination runs by hardening auth, workspace isolation, workflow-tool semantics, hook integration, and prompt affordance boundaries.
- **PRs Merged**: [#1099](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1099)

## [0.1.88] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- **Antigravity CLI Backend** ([#1097](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1097)): New `massgen/backend/antigravity_cli.py` wraps Google's `agy` binary as a MassGen backend. It accepts the `antigravity_cli` backend type, streams content from the subprocess, tails Antigravity session logs for tool/thinking events, and exposes provider metadata through the backend capabilities registry.
- **Workspace-Local Antigravity Isolation** ([#1097](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1097)): The backend passes Antigravity's hidden `--gemini_dir <workspace>/.antigravity` flag so MCP config and settings stay inside the run workspace instead of mutating the user's global `~/.gemini/` config.
- **Antigravity MCP Config Translation** ([#1097](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1097)): MassGen MCP server entries are translated to Antigravity's `mcp_config.json` schema, including `serverUrl` for HTTP servers and `command`/`args`/`env` for stdio servers.
- **Native Hook Adapter** ([#1097](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1097)): Added `massgen/mcp_tools/native_hook_adapters/antigravity_cli_adapter.py`, reusing Gemini CLI hook behavior for Antigravity's compatible hook protocol.
- **Example Configs** ([#1097](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1097)):
  - `massgen/configs/providers/antigravity/antigravity_cli_local.yaml` — single Antigravity CLI agent
  - `massgen/configs/features/fast_iteration_gemini_antigravity.yaml` — mixed Gemini API + Antigravity CLI fast-iteration run

### Changed
- **Backend Registry and CLI Wiring**: `antigravity_cli` is exported from `massgen/backend/__init__.py`, registered in `massgen/backend/capabilities.py`, and instantiated in `massgen/cli.py`.
- **Workspace Snapshot Hygiene**: `.antigravity` / `.antigravitycli` metadata directories are excluded from meaningful-content and snapshot-copy heuristics.
- **Feature Highlights**: Announcement feature highlights now list Antigravity CLI alongside Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and GitHub Copilot.

### Tests
- `massgen/tests/test_antigravity_cli_backend.py` — 490 lines covering binary discovery, command construction, workspace-local config, MCP config schema, provider metadata, stdout/error streaming, workflow JSON envelopes, Docker/API-key constraints, native hook adapter wiring, and environment passthrough.

### Notes
- Antigravity CLI (`agy`) must be installed separately with `curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash`.
- Local mode can use existing Google OAuth state at `~/.gemini/google_accounts.json`; Docker mode requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` because OAuth state does not cross container boundaries.
- Follow-up Antigravity hardening landed in v0.1.89; Discriminative Criteria Refinements landed in v0.1.90; Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) remain deferred to v0.1.94.

### Technical Details
- **Major Focus**: Add Google Antigravity CLI as a first-class MassGen backend while keeping project-local isolation and MassGen workflow/tool semantics intact.
- **PRs Merged**: [#1097](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1097)
- **Contributors**: @ncrispino, @HenryQi and the MassGen team

## [0.1.87] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- **Framework Comparison Pages** ([#1094](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1094)): Three new "MassGen vs ..." pages under `docs/source/reference/comparisons/` — `crewai.rst`, `langgraph.rst`, `autogen.rst`. Each page positions MassGen's parallel-refinement-with-voting model against the target framework's coordination shape and lists when to reach for one versus the other
- **`llms.txt` Index** ([#1094](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1094)): Curated [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org)-spec index published at the docs site root via Sphinx `html_extra_path` (`docs/source/_extra/llms.txt`) — gives AI agents a small, hand-picked map of the docs
- **`llms-full.txt` Corpus** ([#1094](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1094)): Concatenated full-docs dump (~1 MB across 59 files), generated by a Sphinx `build-finished` hook in `docs/source/conf.py` and shipped alongside `llms.txt` for crawlers that want the complete corpus
- **Docs Landing Page Update** ([#1094](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1094)): "How Does MassGen Compare?" section on `docs/source/index.rst` now lists all four comparisons (LLM Council + the three new ones), with the parent `docs/source/reference/comparisons.rst` losing its "coming soon" note and gaining a toctree
- **README Pointers** ([#1094](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1094)): One-line pointers in `README.md` (and synced `README_PYPI.md`) directing AI agents to `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt`

### Fixed
- **`bootstrap_subagent` Discriminator Single-Shot** ([#1094](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1094)): `Orchestrator._run_bootstrap_discriminator_step` now passes `refine=False` to `SubagentManager.spawn_subagent`. This is the canonical single-shot knob that `SubagentManager` actually respects at the orchestrator level — without it, the orchestrator's `max_new_answers_per_agent: 3` default shadowed the coordination-dict overrides, letting the discriminator refine instead of single-shot. Found via live log inspection (`log_20260513_095921_816676`)
  - `massgen/orchestrator.py:1298` — `refine=False` added to `spawn_subagent` call
  - `massgen/tests/test_bootstrap_criteria.py` — new assertion that `discriminator must pass refine=False to spawn_subagent for single-shot`

### Documentations, Configurations and Resources
- **Comparison pages**: `docs/source/reference/comparisons/{crewai,langgraph,autogen}.rst`
- **Sphinx `build-finished` hook**: `docs/source/conf.py` — generates `llms-full.txt` from the source tree at build time
- **README pointers**: `README.md`, `README_PYPI.md` — AI agents are directed to `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt`

### Notes
- Originally-planned Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) and Discriminative Criteria Refinements deferred to v0.1.88.
- Closes [#1082](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/1082) (publish `llms.txt` + `llms-full.txt`) and [#1083](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/1083) (CrewAI / LangGraph / AutoGen comparison pages).

### Technical Details
- **Major Focus**: Make MassGen discoverable to AI agents and crawlers, and give human readers structured "MassGen vs ..." comparisons against the three frameworks most often asked about
- **PRs Merged**: [#1094](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1094)
- **Issues Closed**: [#1082](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/1082), [#1083](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/1083)

## [0.1.86] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **Functional `bootstrap_subagent` Variant**: `orchestrator.coordination.criteria_mode: bootstrap_subagent` now runs a between-rounds LLM critic via `Orchestrator._run_bootstrap_discriminator_step()`. The critic reads the task and each agent's latest answer, emits `proposed_criteria` as JSON, and the orchestrator merges them into the accumulator for the next round's checklist.
- **Discriminator De-Duping Gate**: `_maybe_run_bootstrap_discriminator` runs the critic once per unique answer snapshot, avoiding repeated critiques when the visible answer set has not changed.
- **Session-End Criteria Drain**: `Orchestrator._drain_at_session_end` forces a final drain before final presentation so late stdio JSONL emissions are not stranded after the last checklist resolution pass.

### Fixed
- **Codex MCP Approval Bypass**: `CodexBackend._write_workspace_config` now writes both top-level `approval_policy = "never"` and per-MCP-server `default_tools_approval_mode = "approve"` for non-interactive approval modes. This prevents external MCP tools such as `submit_checklist`, `create_task_plan`, `new_answer`, and `read_media` from failing immediately with "user cancelled MCP tool call" under `codex exec`.

### Documentations, Configurations and Resources
- **Updated Config**: `massgen/configs/coordination/bootstrap_subagent_criteria.yaml` now documents the v0.1.86+ active critic-driven flow.

### Tests
- `massgen/tests/test_bootstrap_criteria.py` — expanded to 35 tests covering session-end drain, mocked discriminator spawning and merge behavior, static/inline no-op paths, and empty-answer no-op behavior.
- `massgen/tests/test_codex_native_hook_adapter.py::TestCodexWorkspaceApprovalPolicy` — covers Codex workspace approval policy output across approval modes.

### Notes
- Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) remain deferred to v0.1.87.

### Technical Details
- **Major Focus**: Complete the discriminative criteria emergence story by making the dedicated critic-driven path functional, and restore Codex MCP tool-call reliability for non-interactive automation.
- **PRs Merged**: [#1090](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1090)

## [0.1.85] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **Discriminative Criteria Emergence**: New `orchestrator.coordination.criteria_mode` option lets evaluation criteria emerge from observed gaps across rounds, instead of requiring them to be authored upfront via `--eval-criteria` or `--checklist-criteria-preset`. Two variants:
  - **`bootstrap_inline`** (fully functional on **all backends with checklist tool support** — SDK *and* stdio): each agent emits a short `proposed_criteria` list alongside its `submit_checklist` call — criteria a stronger answer would satisfy that the current answers do *not*. Proposals are deduped by exact text, FIFO-capped (`bootstrap_max_total`, default 30), persisted to `bootstrap_criteria_accumulator.json` in the session log dir, and merged into the next round's effective checklist via the existing `EvaluationSection` machinery. SDK path (Claude Code) gets the field directly in the in-process tool schema; stdio backends (gemini, codex, response, chat_completions, claude, grok) get a JSONL emission channel — `proposed_criteria.jsonl` next to the checklist specs, drained by the orchestrator on each criteria resolution.
  - **`bootstrap_subagent`** (wired, LLM step deferred): same accumulator pipeline but criteria are intended to come from a between-rounds critic rather than the agents. The accumulator still propagates seeded entries; the in-process LLM discriminator pass is queued for v0.1.86.
- **`massgen/bootstrap_criteria.py`** (new module): houses `merge_proposals`, `augment_with_accumulator`, `is_bootstrap_mode`, and `validate_criteria_mode` — pure helpers shared between orchestrator and tests.
- **Coordination Config Fields**: `CoordinationConfig.{criteria_mode, bootstrap_max_per_agent_per_round, bootstrap_max_total}` — parsed in `cli.py:_parse_coordination_config`, validated in `CoordinationConfig._validate_criteria_mode`, excluded from API params in `backend/base.py:get_base_excluded_config_params`.
- **SDK Path Wiring** (`Orchestrator._init_checklist_tool_sdk`): the `submit_checklist` schema gains an optional `proposed_criteria` array in `bootstrap_inline` mode only; static-mode agents see the historical schema unchanged. Parsed proposals land on `AgentState.criteria_proposals` and are drained into the orchestrator's accumulator on each criteria resolution.
- **Stdio Path Wiring** (`massgen/mcp_tools/checklist_tools_server.py`): the FastMCP `submit_checklist` tool conditionally adds `proposed_criteria` to its `inspect.Signature` when `state["criteria_mode"] == "bootstrap_inline"`. Emissions are appended to `proposed_criteria.jsonl` in the specs directory; `Orchestrator._drain_pending_criteria_proposals` reads and truncates the file each pass.

### Why This Matters
- Removes a cold-start friction: users no longer need to pre-author criteria for a new task. The first round produces both answers *and* the criteria the second round must rise to.
- **Anti-Goodhart by construction** — criteria come from observed gaps, not priors that may not match the task.
- Uses MassGen's multi-round/multi-agent shape directly; the cross-agent channel (workspace sharing) already existed, so no new transport was needed.

### Documentations, Configurations and Resources
- **New Configs**: `massgen/configs/coordination/bootstrap_inline_criteria.yaml` and `bootstrap_subagent_criteria.yaml` (forked from `features/fast_iteration.yaml`) — runnable examples for both variants
- **Updated `docs/modules/coordination_workflow.md`**: new section documenting `criteria_mode`, accumulator semantics, and the two variants

### Tests
- `massgen/tests/test_bootstrap_criteria.py` — 30 new tests (476 lines) covering merge/dedup/cap, config validation, `AgentState.criteria_proposals` field, `_resolve_effective_checklist_criteria` augmentation across criteria sources, `EvaluationSection` rendering gating, `_drain_pending_criteria_proposals` behavior, and round-N → round-N+1 propagation end-to-end

### Notes
- Originally-planned Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) deferred to v0.1.86.
- `bootstrap_subagent` LLM discriminator pass queued for v0.1.86.

### Technical Details
- **Major Focus**: Let evaluation criteria emerge from the run rather than be pre-authored — anti-Goodhart, anti-cold-start, and natively shaped by MassGen's multi-round refinement loop
- **Contributors**: @ncrispino, @HenryQi and the MassGen team

## [0.1.84] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- **TUI Consensus Map** ([#1085](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1085)): Compact visual map mounted below the agent status ribbon during multi-agent runs that summarizes coordination state without replacing the timeline. Shows one node per agent with latest answer labels, vote direction arrows, current vote leader, winner state, and waiting/working indicators. Hidden on welcome screen and single-agent runs
  - `massgen/frontend/displays/textual_widgets/consensus_map.py` — new `ConsensusMapState`, `ConsensusAgentState`, `ConsensusMapSnapshot`, and `ConsensusMap` widget
  - `massgen/frontend/displays/textual_widgets/__init__.py` — widget export
  - `massgen/frontend/displays/textual_terminal_display.py` — mounting below status ribbon, event/status wiring, visibility logic
  - `massgen/frontend/displays/tui_event_pipeline.py` — event routing for the map
  - `massgen/frontend/displays/textual_themes/base.tcss` — consensus map theme styling
- **Event-Driven State Updates** ([#1085](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1085)): The Consensus Map subscribes to existing structured coordination events (`answer_submitted`, `vote`, `agent_stopped`, `winner_selected`, `final_presentation_start`, `agent_restart`, `phase_change`, `context_received`) — no backend schema changes required
- **Direct-Callback Fallback** ([#1085](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1085)): When direct TUI callbacks update agent status or votes (without the unified event pipeline), the map remains accurate for the same visible state

### Documentations, Configurations and Resources
- **OpenSpec Change Proposal**: `openspec/changes/add-tui-consensus-map/{proposal,tasks}.md` and `specs/textual-tui/spec.md` — full design proposal, scenario coverage, and validation tasks

### Tests
- `massgen/tests/frontend/test_consensus_map.py` — unit tests for state transitions and Textual widget compact rendering / visibility (244 lines)
- `massgen/tests/frontend/test_timeline_snapshot_scaffold.py` — runtime TUI snapshot coverage for answer/vote/winner state (+68 lines)
- `massgen/tests/frontend/__snapshots__/test_timeline_snapshot_scaffold/test_timeline_snapshot_real_tui_consensus_map.svg` — golden TUI snapshot

### Notes
- Originally-planned Image/Video Edit Capabilities ([#959](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/959)) deferred to v0.1.85.

### Technical Details
- **Major Focus**: Make the physical shape of multi-agent collaboration visible at a glance — convergence, votes, and leader without scanning timelines and toasts
- **PRs Merged**: [#1085](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1085)
- **Contributors**: @ncrispino, @HenryQi and the MassGen team

## [0.1.83] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- **In-Session Standalone Checkpoint MCP** ([#1079](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1079)): The standalone checkpoint MCP server (originally for external hosts like Claude Code) can now be exposed *inside* a normal MassGen run, so a single-agent session can call its richer `init` + `checkpoint` tools and have its own reviewer team evaluate plans
  - `massgen/mcp_tools/standalone/checkpoint_mcp_server.py` — wired into in-session orchestration
  - `massgen/orchestrator.py` — orchestrator integration with affordance gating
  - `massgen/system_message_builder.py`, `massgen/system_prompt_sections.py` — standalone checkpoint prompt section
- **`coordination.standalone_checkpoint` Config Block** ([#1079](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1079)): New YAML block under `orchestrator.coordination` with fields:
  - `enabled` (bool, default `false`) — opt-in gate
  - `team_config` (path) — team YAML the standalone server runs
  - `mode` (`generate` | `verify`, default `generate`) — invalid values fall back to `generate` with a warning
  - `single_checkpoint` (bool, default `false`) — one-shot checkpoint per session
  - `include_workspace_context` (bool, default `false`) — mount parent workspace read-only for reviewers
  - `massgen/agent_config.py` — `CoordinationConfig` fields and `to_dict` serialization
  - `massgen/cli.py` — `_parse_standalone_checkpoint` parser with mode validation
- **Enhanced Checkpoint Tool Card** ([#1079](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1079)): Tool card visualization distinguishes primary operations from system tasks with improved context and result display
  - `massgen/frontend/displays/textual_widgets/tool_card.py`
- **Example Configs** ([#1079](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1079)):
  - `massgen/configs/checkpoint/standalone_mcp/fast_iteration.yaml` — fast-iteration single-agent run with in-session standalone checkpoint
  - `massgen/configs/checkpoint/standalone_mcp/reviewers.yaml` — reviewer team config for the standalone server

### Changed
- **Single-Agent-Only Affordance Gating** ([#1079](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1079)): When `standalone_checkpoint.enabled: true` is set on a multi-agent parent, the system skips the standalone server with a warning (the standalone server runs its own reviewer panel)

## [0.1.78] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Circuit Breaker Distributed Store (Phase 4)** ([#1061](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1061)): Pluggable *state store* for the LLM circuit breaker. Previously each process kept its own CB state, so one worker tripping OPEN did not stop siblings from hammering a rate-limited upstream. CB state (failure counts, open/half-open/closed, cooldown timers) can now be shared across workers and processes. Default (`store=None`) keeps the existing single-process path unchanged.
  - `CircuitBreakerStore` Protocol: the interface the CB uses to persist state
  - `InMemoryStore` (CB state store): thread-safe, zero-deps — useful for single-process and tests
  - `RedisStore` (distributed CB state store): shares CB state across processes via Redis (`redis>=4.0`, lazy-imported); available through the optional `redis-store` extra
  - Atomic `atomic_record_failure` / `atomic_record_success` so CB state transitions are linearizable when workers race on the same backend
- **Optional Redis Dependency Group**: New `redis-store` extra for the Redis-backed CB store — install with `pip install massgen[redis-store]`

### Tests
- **CB Store Unit Tests** ([#1061](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1061)): New `massgen/tests/test_cb_store.py` covering `InMemoryStore` and `RedisStore` behavior, Protocol contract, and metrics integration
- **CB Store Adversarial Tests** ([#1061](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/1061)): New `massgen/tests/test_cb_store_adversarial.py` covering TOCTOU races, Redis eviction, corrupted state handling, CAS semantics, probe-claiming, and TTL edge cases

### Documentation, Configurations and Resources
- **New Roadmap**: New `ROADMAP_v0.1.79.md` for the next release
- **Updated `pyproject.toml`**: Added `redis-store` optional dependency group

## [0.0.11] - 2025-08-25

### Known Issues
- **System Message Handling in Multi-Agent Coordination**: Critical issues affecting Claude Code agents
  - **Lost System Messages During Final Presentation** (`orchestrator.py:1183`)
    - Claude Code agents lose domain expertise during final presentation
    - ConfigurableAgent doesn't properly expose system messages via `agent.system_message`
  - **Backend Ignores System Messages** (`claude_code.py:754-762`)
    - Claude Code backend filters out system messages from presentation_messages
    - Only processes user messages, causing loss of agent expertise context
    - System message handling only works during initial client creation, not with `reset_chat=True`
  - **Ambiguous Configuration Sources**
    - Multiple conflicting system message sources: `custom_system_instruction`, `system_prompt`, `append_system_prompt`
    - Backend parameters silently override AgentConfig settings
    - Unclear precedence and behavior documentation
  - **Architecture Violations**
    - Orchestrator contains Claude Code-specific implementation details
